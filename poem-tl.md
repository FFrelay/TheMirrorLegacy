In chaotic times, millions were slain,
Of the whole family, I alone remain.
A fate so cruel, Heaven's judgment is due~
A fate so cruel, may Heaven run me through.

In years past, a single clan ruled the prefecture...
How many storms have now passed? North and south clash, heads rolling fast...
The common folk suffer, to misery cast~
An injustice that will forever last!

In years past, this forest became a domain of ghosts...
Where even great demons hid their boasts...
A ghostly wind sweeping men from their posts...

Tossed about, with no path to take, how can a ghost compare to an immortal's make? But He became an immortal! The world revolves, the land brightens~ all at his command, Ghost envoys of five directions call wind and thunder~ subject to his demand.

White bones overflow, spring freezes the blood, A river of red tears, a drifting flood.
I wander alone, a solitary ghost, Father, Brother! Gone those I loved the most. Where have they gone, the days of old?
My spirit remains, bitter and cold. Body like withered wood, adrift without a root, In ragged clothes, a wandering destitute.

Invited to the immortal peaks, seated on the golden dias,
Watching the glows of dusk, half-hidden from the heaven's gaze.
Snow-white candles burn, spirit robes of vibrant light,
Are the affair of the mortal world settled right?
I lament I am not a floating cloud,
My young Qilin of the mountains, followed by a crowd.
From dark windows, mortals looked up, admiring your boast...
Oh, my descendant! How did you become a ghost?

Raising the emerald palace, paving the jade tower,
Let your light reflect the blood on the ghostly wind's brow.
The three great halls, the moonlit rain,
Control your nature, and you too can become a golden rainbow.
If there were truly a path to immortality,
Why would they ever let you have it?
I fear it is all... a flute playing chaos on the wind,
The deceptive scent of a drooling dragon.
