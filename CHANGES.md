## In-Chapter Textual Changes

-   Standardized all remaining instances of 'Tingzhou' to 'Ting Province' for consistency.
-   Standardized all remaining instances of 'Xiyang Temple' to 'Xiyang Abbey' for consistency.

## Chapter Numbering Changes

-   Corrected a significant numbering error where chapters were incorrectly offset by +3. All chapters have been re-indexed 3 numbers lower (e.g., the chapter previously numbered as 1204 is now correctly Ch. 1201).
-   Added the previously missing chapter (now correctly numbered as Ch. 1201).
