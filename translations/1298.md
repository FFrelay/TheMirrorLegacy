# Chapter 1298: Lady of Thunder

A clear, cold voice drifted down, causing the lightning at the lake's bottom to boil and shatter the surface's tranquility. Amidst the fragmented reflections, a fair, slender hand could be faintly seen, pressing gently upon the pitch-black Iron Edict Elixir.

The Treasure Light shone brilliantly, making her hand seem even more pristine by comparison. Heaven and earth fell silent. Chiguang held back, tacitly permitting the hand's owner to take the Spiritual Treasure, allowing the rare prize to float within the endlessly surging force of Primordial Magnetism.

"Boom!"

Bright lightning blasted through the world, piercing the endless currents from the sky to slam down, and for an instant, the pitch-black, boundless riverbed was illuminated!

The light illuminated the shocked and horrified faces of the divine ability masters. Chiguang’s indifferent pupils stared at her from afar, yet he remained silent, allowing the lightning to flash across his features as the surrounding scenery was drowned in brilliance.

The purple lightning radiated outward from the center of the ruined hall, its mirror-smooth light reflecting the figures of the divine ability masters. Vaguely, one could see the roiling thunder at the bottom of the Thunder Lake, emanating an immense pressure.

All the masters ceased their attacks simultaneously, their vision of the surroundings lost, and cautiously retreated a step under the endless lightning.

Fortunately, the light dissipated in an instant.

Chunshuo's brows shot up, his heart lurching.

Suspended above the Thunder Pool was an enormous, pristine thunder-disk etched with purple jade patterns. The surging river water, driven by the Primordial Magnetism, rapidly receded, forming a vast, bright void at the bottom of the river!

Dense purple lightning slithered across the watery walls of the void like ten million-strong Flood Dragons looking down. The woman was exceptionally beautiful, with pale purple eyes and clad in a feathered, purple-white lightning robe. The silver-patterned boots on her feet glinted coldly. Like an elegant-profound bird, she hovered at the center of the thunder-disk, her long spear held at an angle as countless lightning bolts converged upon its tip.

'She is...'

Numerous gazes, filled with confusion or horror, shifted toward her. The shock of the gold-robed Daoist Master was no less than theirs. He stood above the Thunder Pool for a moment in disbelief.

'She... how can it be her... It's not Dongfang Heyun, it's her... The Dragon Monarch's usurpation of lightning has already reached such a state!'

Chunshuo hailed from the Azure Revolution Heaven and thus understood these matters better. His eyes filled with shock, and his lips trembled as he murmured,

"Li Qinghong..."

"Boom!"

The bright lightning illuminated Li Que'wan's face, as well as the fervent light shining in her eyes. She stared excitedly at the figure in the sky, at the small white-flower hairpin tucked into the dark hair, and at the fair profile turned toward her.

It was Li Qinghong.

Li Que'wan was lost in a daze, time seeming to flow backward. She felt as if she were standing in that small courtyard once more, the world rumbling with thunder, as the woman before her held her small hand, shielding her just as she was today.

The leaden river water had receded, and the masters' spiritual senses, no longer suppressed, began to spread. Chunshuo's quiet voice echoed swiftly through the void, and in the next instant, a cold, imposing voice rang out from above,

"Li Qinghong?!"

Chiguang's voice was icy, his expression cautious.

This Great Daoist Master had, of course, recognized the newcomer and instantly understood the lightning cultivator's connection to the Li clan.

Had it been Dongfang Heyun—a manifestation of the Dragon Monarch's Fruition Attainment authority—Chiguang would have turned and fled without hesitation the moment the mists appeared. But instead, it was this lightning wielder. Chiguang had associated with many Golden Core direct-lineage disciples and knew more than most. He was already weighing his options.

'The Dragon Monarch consumed the lightning, and Li Qinghong reaped the benefits, thereby gaining her divine ability. But the external Profound Mystery she Borrowed... it's different from Dongfang Heyun's. It relies only on a minor connection of merit to the Dragon Monarch... And besides, she still has to venture deeper into the grotto-heaven...'

Her aura was indeed terrifying, and lightning cultivators were known for their boundless power, but Chiguang understood one thing—neither she nor Dongfang Heyun actually possessed a divine ability!

Dongfang Heyun's power and methods were too profound, but Li Qinghong was not necessarily the same. Chiguang's own Dao lineage was unique; it was not impossible for him to put up a fight!

'But it is dangerous, and entirely unnecessary.'

The Dragon-kin were infamously vengeful, and Li Qinghong was now one of theirs. Fighting her was already a risk. If he won, he would be slapping the face of the Dragon-kin; if he lost, his life would be endangered and he would lose this opportunity. Why bother?

Without a trace of embarrassment or hesitation on his face, Chiguang abruptly waved his sleeve under the expectant gazes of the masters in that vast, thunderous void, his body exploding into a cloud of drifting mist.

He was actually turning to flee!

Yet before his form could dissipate, dense heavenly lightning crashed down, blasting him from the rolling mist. Chiguang was forced to wave his hand, erasing the destructive thunderbolt, his pupils already reflecting a purple glow. His only answer was the profound spear shooting across the void, carrying with it infinite lightning!

Thunder roared and the river waters raged!

'She attacked!'

Chunshuo's expression changed, and he scattered into golden light. In the void, Pit Water flowed and Buddhist light fled as the many masters retreated simultaneously!

Only Chiguang remained suspended in mid-air, his hands forming a seal. He watched the massive, sky-blotting lightning, a flicker of apprehension in his eyes as he stared at her coldly.

"Let us see just how much power you truly possess."

'Technique of the Spirit-Town Stele!'

The stone stele behind him rose infinitely, threatening to pierce the very void. He raised his fingers once more, catching the spear between them. All the lightning was instantly transferred to the colossal stele behind him, leaving him completely unharmed, his eyes filled only with an endless purple reflection.

Between the gaps in the purple cascade of lightning, he finally saw her eyes.

Unexpectedly, despite wielding such terrifying power, her almond eyes were calm and gentle, her gaze firm and strong. There was only a trace of anger from her junior being injured, causing her willow-thin brows to furrow slightly.

Chiguang stared for only that instant, but an overwhelming force seemed to erupt between them. His expression changed abruptly. The stele behind him boomed as the profound spear, defying all reason, passed straight through his fingers and shot toward his chest!

'Not good!'

His face paled as he realized the terrifying thunder-disk now dominated the void, stripping him of all surrounding cloud-qi. In the final instant before his divine ability could activate, the profound spear pierced his chest!

Floating Cloud Body!

Just as the intense lightning burst forth, Chiguang's figure dissolved in time, scattering like wind and clouds. But the woman merely advanced one step. Above the Thunder Pool, roaming the void, millions upon millions of lightning bolts descended as one.

"Boom!"

In an instant, Chiguang had already shifted several li, his figure struck down by the boundless lightning. He suddenly turned back as the Jade Azure Bracelet leaped up to strike the profound spear.

Yet the profound spear merely spun once before the slender hand thrust forward again, and it was already upon him!

A fist-sized hole had appeared in his chest, flickering with undying lightning. The Immortal Dao genius of Overlook Township Pavilion showed little discomfort, his brow merely furrowed. He finally steeled himself and began to invoke another divine ability.

Qi's Advent!

The divine ability flashed. Myriad streams of white qi seemed to arrive from all corners of the void, descending like silk banners amidst the vast, endless sound of scriptures being taught. He actually became immune to the lightning, wandering freely on the wind straight for a hundred li!

But the purple lightning raced, and it was faster still!

Everything beneath his feet had already transformed into a Thunder Pool. The profound-bird-like figure stood in the distance, her spear planted in the ground. Her pristine hand rose slowly, grasping the small white-flower hairpin tucked in her dark, coiled hair.

The simple hairpin seemed unremarkable, yet it felt as heavy as a mountain. As she drew it free, her dark hair cascaded down like a waterfall, adding a wild, unfettered beauty to her.

Chiguang's pupils finally trembled. He felt a long-absent sense of danger: this lightning would undoubtedly wound his very foundation!

The previous chest wound and the falling lightning had been manageable. Pure Qi was inviolable by most arts and highly resistant to all Dao lineages. But this lightning was different. If he sustained such an injury within the grotto-heaven, it meant he would be cut off from nearly all the great opportunities that followed!

Losing face or begging for mercy was as meaningless as a passing cloud, but to sever his opportunities was to strike at his fundamental interests. Chiguang's brow tightened. The light in his hand flickered, revealing the dark glow of Valley Water as his voice condensed into a single line,

"I had no intent to harm, and I let your clan's Daoist Master leave. It was but a single harsh word! Why must your spirit-lightning press me so? If you spare me to pursue my opportunities in this grotto-heaven, I will surely repay this debt!"

"Boom."

His only response was a surge of countless purple lights. All the lightning condensed into a giant shadow that gripped him in its palm. The lightning from the white-flower hairpin illuminated his face. Standing atop that shadow, Li Qinghong looked like a celestial maiden beloved by the thunder of heaven and earth, her eyes overflowing with purple light as she parted her lips.

"Edict."

_Boom!_

...

Lightning rapidly consumed the sky, and an intense brilliance filled the void for an instant. The patter of falling rain echoed through the utter silence between the palaces. The brother and sister remained standing in place, speechless.

Li Jiangqian stared at the colossal figure of lightning in the distance, his expression strange, utterly dumbfounded. After a long moment, he murmured,

"That's true..."

If Dongfang Heyun could use a hidden pawn to enter, so could Li Qinghong!

Li Que'wan's face was flushed. She gazed at the colors in the distance, as if she had a thousand things to say but could not utter a single word. Only when the distant lightning began to slowly dissipate did she speak, her voice apprehensive,

"Does this mean... the fight is over..."

She turned her head anxiously, looking all around.

"Senior Wushao... Senior Wushao!"

"Hah!"

The voice came from far away. The black-robed man was dashing through the ruins, frantically stuffing every treasure rolling on the ground into his robes. He cared not whether they were for the Foundation Establishment Realm or Qi Refining, modern instruments or ancient artifacts; he just kept grabbing. He seemed to have already filled his storage bag and was now using a divine ability to hold the overflow.

At his core, Li Wushao still had the mentality of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Which of these treasures wouldn't be madly fought over outside? His heart was burning with greed. With all the masters gone, he was reaping a massive windfall!

Hearing her call, Li Wushao hurriedly returned with his haul, rushing before the pair.

"Aiyah, is that powerful cultivator coming back? Which way should we run? Or... should I just go back inside the Iron Edict Elixir?"

Greedy though he was, the old demon still knew his own limits. Li Que'wan was taken aback.

"Why are you running? Do not be disrespectful in her presence..."

'So, she's one of us!'

Before she could finish, a bright purple light traveled from afar, materializing before the hall. A powerful, thunderous pressure descended instantly. Countless artifacts, seized by the Primordial Magnetism, began to tremble and float. The old demon didn't even look, just dropped to his knees in a practiced motion.

"Greetings, my lady!"

But he heard a clear voice laugh in response.

"Li Wushao, oh, Li Wushao! You haven't changed a bit."

Li Wushao froze, then jerked his head up to see that face, the almond eyes and willow brows. The old demon beast rose slowly, treasures clattering to the ground from his robes. He stumbled back two steps, his voice choked with emotion.

"It's...It's... Lady Qinghong!"

Though foul-mouthed and greedy, this old snake was extremely nostalgic. After mixing with humans for so many years, this trait had only become more pronounced. The withering of old friends, one by one, had brought him great sadness. In recent years, whenever he sat idle, he would often grow melancholic, and he even gave special care to the descendants of those he had known.

Li Qinghong's sudden appearance was like bringing all those people and memories back to life, and tears streamed down his face.

"They... they all said you perished in the Eastern Sea!"

Li Qinghong's voice was faintly hoarse, but she was still smiling.

"With so many masters fighting so fiercely, you still couldn't see clearly? I suppose I fought that battle in vain."

Seeing her, Li Wushao was reminded of the banter from their very first meeting. He could almost hear Li Yuanjiao's laughter ringing in his ears. The old demon wept.

"This little demon didn't dare look... I wanted to bury my head in my chest!"

"My master was cautious in all things, and I learned at least half of that. I never look at the faces of such powerful masters. It's true... the voice did sound familiar, but this little demon didn't dare presume..."

He bawled, and Li Qinghong merely patted his shoulder gently. Her purple-white feathered lightning robe rustled in the current. The beautiful woman stood with her spear, a graceful and solitary figure.

Her bearing was valiant, her eyes clear—a flash of brilliance plunging into these gloomy depths, a sight one could not look away from.

Li Que'wan's eyes welled with tears.

Of the many Li clan elders—Li Xuanxuan, who cared for her in all things; Li Ximing, so kind and bright; Li Zhouwei, whose authority was like a mountain—the one Li Que'wan could never forget was still the woman before her!

Years ago, it was Li Qinghong who had picked her up, carried her from the riverbank all the way to Pingya Island, and brought her into the towering great hall. Li Qinghong was her first-ever impression of a high cultivator, but she had vanished after just one short period of cultivation...

Her temperament was gentle on the surface but iron-willed within, and she never showed weakness. Yet at this moment, she could not help but let out a sob. She hurried forward, only to stop shyly before the woman, suddenly as apprehensive as a child.

"My lady!"

Li Jiangqian stood silently behind her, his complicated gaze passing over his sister's shoulder to rest on Li Qinghong. The woman turned to look at him, a smile slowly forming in her eyes.

"You're both masters now."

Hearing this, Li Que'wan's tears flowed even more freely. The ethereal woman's eyes, hazy with purple, also held a trace of melancholy. She raised her hand, wiping her cheek.

"Wan'er... you've grown so beautiful."
