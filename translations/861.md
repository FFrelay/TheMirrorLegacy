# Chapter 861: The Lethal Force of Bright Yang

As Li Ximing’s thought flashed by, the rainbow light in the sky broke free from the suppression of his Divine Ability, _Audience with the Celestial Gate_, and swelled back to its original, brilliant size.

The three-eyed Merciful One finally received the full empowerment of its own divine ability. It grew two more arms, for a total of four, and in each hand, a phantom golden weapon materialized—a saber, a spear, an axe, and a club.

Chiluo was still casting his spell. He saw Li Ximing's _Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire_ hurtling toward him, followed closely by the _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ Divine Ability. With grim resolve, Chiluo withdrew the pagoda he had been using to suppress the fire, recalling it to protect himself and leaving the three figures before him completely exposed.

From this single move, Li Ximing knew the old cultivator was no fool.

_Audience with the Celestial Gate_ was a Divine Ability that suppressed artifacts. Buddhist cultivators were not known for their skill in artifact refinement, so Chiluo's pagoda was certainly no match for a proper spiritual artifact. If it were pinned down, he could forget about ever retrieving it.

But this retreat left his allies exposed to the menacing Li Ximing. The three-eyed Merciful One, though it had just been scorched by True Fire, was now empowered and charged forward to meet the threat. Just as it raised its four arms to defend, the Profound Light of _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ coalesced into a gateway as tall as a man and slammed toward the group.

The three-eyed Merciful One was clever. It took a step forward, positioning itself before the heavily injured, hammer-wielding Merciful One who had yet to recover, intending to meet any attack head-on. To its surprise, _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ bypassed it entirely and shot straight for Chiluo.

Chiluo was halfway through casting a Dharma Art, clearly trying to invoke his own divine empowerment. Seeing the gate coming for him, his expression turned cold. Unwilling to sacrifice his pagoda to finish casting, and even less willing to have his connection to the empowerment severed and be trapped, he aborted the Dharma Art. Enduring the bone-chilling Profound Light, his body dissolved into fire and scattered.

The three-eyed Merciful One, Pingling, instantly realized he had been tricked and moved to help. But none of them wanted to be trapped under the gate, sacrificing themselves for another's benefit. Pingling’s four arms swung in unison, its golden weapons striking only at Li Ximing's Dharma Body.

The discord among the Buddhist cultivators gave Li Ximing an opening. His _Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen_ flared to life as he suddenly turned his head, and a beam of Profound Light burst from the center of his brow.

He braced himself against the four golden weapons, determined to ensnare the fleeing Chiluo with his _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_. Meanwhile, _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ soared high into the air, poised to descend and suppress Chiluo from above. The red-faced Merciful One’s expression grew darker by the second.

Now, the other two Merciful Ones had no choice but to act. If they held back any longer and Chiluo escaped to the Buddhist Land, he would surely report them. Since Chiluo served under the Golden Lotus Seat, they would face dire consequences.

After a brief exchange, the two were forced to traverse the Great Void to intercept the _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_.

Under the assault of Pingling's four golden weapons, Li Ximing's _Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen_ shattered. Immediately, the brownish-yellow light of his _Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption_ flared up in its place. This wondrous ability had limited uses—it couldn't defend against the twelve essences or fire-virtue attacks—but it held firm against the golden weapons.

Sparks flew with a deafening clang as the rainbow clouds in the sky trembled. A surge of pale white Bright Yang energy erupted from his position, followed by a gush of violet Bright Yang fire. But Li Ximing himself had vanished.

The two Merciful Ones who had gone to intercept the _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ had just reappeared when a chill shot down their spines. The _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ that had been chasing Chiluo had stopped precisely above them. It fell like a golden mountain, crashing down on their heads.

_BOOM!_

The stunning blow lit up the sky, shattering their protective auras in an instant. Their knees buckled with a sickening crunch, and the Dharma Power within them stagnated. The next moment, a rift opened in the Great Void beneath the gate. A hand as white as jade shot through the Profound Light, aiming for one of their faces.

The palm landed squarely on the forehead of the majestic, golden face.

Stripped of the protection of its aura and the rainbow light, the head, harder than any artifact, held for only a moment before exploding. A tsunami of golden flames and violent purple fire erupted along with it. The rest of the body was blown to smithereens, raining down as a shower of golden gems and precious stones.

At the same time, a vision of a beautiful, prosperous celestial domain filled with countless golden figures flickered at the edge of the sky. It seemed to receive a sliver of rainbow light before vanishing.

Stones flew everywhere on Xiaoshi Mountain, a dazzling, deadly spectacle. A Merciful One had fallen, its essence returning to the Buddhist Land.

_BOOM!_

Immediately after, the _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ hanging in the sky trembled violently. Pingling, having been thoroughly played, was now seeing red. Its four arms pushed against the outside of the gate, shaking the Heavenly Gate relentlessly.

Being outside the gate was a world of difference from being trapped beneath it. Moreover, Pingling now had the full empowerment of its Divine Ability, and each of its shoves sent tremors through Li Ximing's technique. Li Ximing ignored the sword-wielding Merciful One cowering in a corner. With a light flick of his sleeve, he slipped free, allowing the majestic Heavenly Gate to dissolve back into Profound Light. He stood upon the rainbow clouds, panting slightly.

The fully empowered Pingling was not to be underestimated. Although Li Ximing's _Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger_ wasn't used for direct combat, its derivative abilities, the _Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen_ and _Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption_, were still highly effective. The Dharma Power roiled within him but quickly stabilized. He had escaped with nothing more than a slight gash on the shoulder of his Dharma Body.

Pingling's face was so red it looked as if blood might drip from it. Just then, a laugh echoed from mid-air.

"Excellent!"

It was clearly Kui Qi's voice. He was at a slight disadvantage against Vija, but his opponent was hesitant to press him too hard, leaving him the leisure to observe the wider battle.

Li Ximing laughed inwardly.

'This method really works. Changxiao taught me well.'

His ability to inflict such devastating damage in a flash, instantly killing a Merciful One, was primarily because his targets had just emerged from the Great Void. They had no time to react before _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ stunned them, shattering their protective auras. His success was twofold. First, _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ was incredibly effective. Second… he had learned this entire strategy from Changxiao.

Back then, he had been naive and ignorant of how to properly fight with Divine Abilities. Changxiao possessed the uncanny talent of predicting where one would emerge from the Great Void. Every time Li Ximing had traversed it, he would be met with a Dharma Art, nearly getting himself killed within dozens of exchanges. Now, it was his turn to overwhelm others with superior tactics. Though he couldn't predict their exact exit point, by attacking a target they were forced to save, he could anticipate their general position, suppress them by surprise, and unleash his _Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire_ to achieve a miraculous victory.

Li Ximing had only a moment to catch his breath. Before he could celebrate, the rainbow light in the sky finished descending. Chiluo appeared, now with six arms holding two spears, two shields, and two swords, all gleaming gold. Four sharp eyes glared from his face as he rode a winged tiger, striding furiously through the air.

But this Merciful One clearly felt no camaraderie for his fallen companion. Li Ximing saw that while Chiluo's face was a mask of rage, his actions were exceedingly cautious. He held his Treasured Artifacts ready, a powerful flame gathering in his mouth.

Chiluo, after all, served the Golden Lotus Seat. He was at the pinnacle for a Merciful One, with the only differences between his peers being specific Dharma Arts and the possession of Treasured Artifacts. Li Ximing commanded his Heavenly Gate to face Chiluo, who then opened his mouth wide.

_BOOM!_

A blast of intertwined lightning and fire shot out as a beam of spiritual light. Startled, Li Ximing solemnly raised his Divine Ability to defend. The beam struck _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ with a flash of crackling energy, erupting in a cloud of black smoke.

Li Ximing felt a slight sting. His Divine Ability trembled, and the black smoke dissipated. Fortunately, while the beam was powerful, its lightning element was far weaker than its fire. The fire had the flavor of Radiant Fire, though crudely refined. Since Li Ximing's Bright Yang was closely related to Radiant Fire, he wasn't significantly harmed.

But the attack had served its purpose. Chiluo closed the distance to the gate, meeting Li Ximing's _Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire_ head-on with his pagoda. Two long spears appeared in his hands, thrusting through the curtain of fire toward Li Ximing's Dharma Body.

Meanwhile, the three-eyed Merciful One wasn't idle. While still trying to shake the gate, it was using the eye on its forehead to gather Searing light again. A thick, white glow had already accumulated there, its other two eyes locked onto the figure in the white and gold Daoist robes, waiting for the right moment.

Li Ximing activated his _Sun's Resonant Radiance Art_, transforming it into two beams of purple flame that shot out to bind the incoming spears. He then swept his sleeve, releasing a wave of Profound Light that exposed the sword-wielding Merciful One who had been stealthily approaching.

Unfortunately, Chiluo's empowered Dharma Body was far superior to any he had faced before. The _Sun's Resonant Radiance Art_ was not yet profound enough; it held the golden spears for only a moment before they broke free. The winged tiger roared and lunged, snapping its jaws at his robes.

Li Ximing had no choice but to retreat into his Heavenly Gate, using the Divine Ability to block the spears. With a loud crack, his face paled. _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ trembled again, seeming to buckle under the pincer attack from Chiluo and Pingling.

His weakness—a lack of proficiency in spell arts—was finally exposed. He had too few methods to counter his enemies. His _Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire_ was clearly overwhelming the pagoda, yet he was forced to recall the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual fire to push Chiluo back, buying a precious moment. He channeled all his remaining Dharma Power into the disk-shaped spiritual artifact hidden in his sleeve.

The sword-wielding Merciful One, though caught in the Profound Light, pressed forward. Li Ximing had to turn and release his _Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light_ at it, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart.

As expected, Pingling did not miss such a golden opportunity. The white light that had been gathering in its third eye shot forth. Chiluo was a veteran; his eyes lit up, and with a furious roar, he joined in shaking the Divine Ability. The white light pierced through the Profound Light and descended upon Li Ximing.

The _Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen_ and _Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption_ lit up simultaneously. The silken screen, which had served him well, was shredded by the brilliant light. It only weakened the glow slightly before it struck Li Ximing's sleeve. To his astonishment, the brownish-yellow _Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption_ was useless against the white light, offering no resistance at all. As the brilliant light fell, he only had time to detonate a cluster of purple flames in a brilliant flash.

'This is… the orthodox brilliant light of the Buddhist cultivators! Its source is the twelve qis! Their brilliant light truly is one of them—the Brilliant Qi!'

In that instant, Li Ximing recalled what Changxi had said before his death and what Li Zhouwei had once mentioned about Bai Rong and the Dry Qi. A searing red burn appeared on his wrist. Affected by the injury, his _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ finally dimmed.

He endured the stinging pain and surged his Dharma Power once more. Chiluo, however, had shaken off the _Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire_. His two golden spears pierced through the Profound Light, stabbing viciously toward Li Ximing's chest.

At this critical moment, despite his miscalculation and injury, Li Ximing gave a cold smile. A brilliant golden object fell from his sleeve.

The _Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass_!

The eight directional runes carved into the compass now shone with blinding intensity. The fine, pale-white incantations circling its edge were layered so densely they had become almost pure white. At its center, a dazzling golden radiance pulsed, hovering before his chest. He had been secretly channeling Dharma Power into it for so long, enduring injury without wavering. Now, the golden light split into four stars, forming a '匚' shape slanted toward the north. The leading point of light radiated an overwhelming authority that froze the two incoming golden spears in place.

The Upper Shining Star, held in ascendance—the lethal light of Bright Yang!

Chiluo's empowerment gave him some divinatory skill. He received a premonition of danger—a frigid chill spread through him, and a burning pain erupted in his chest. His two shield-bearing hands retracted to block his front.

The lethal light of Bright Yang descended from the _Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass_. It made no sound, like opening a skylight in a dim attic. A beam of golden-white brilliance fell, striking the two golden shields Chiluo had just managed to raise.

The shields were unceremoniously reduced to ash, not even leaving behind molten gold. The lethal light dimmed slightly before gently landing on Chiluo's arms.

The dense golden runes covering his arms all lit up, shining with ultimate brilliance before exploding into black smoke. The next instant, the arms themselves turned to ash. Chiluo's pupils filled with molten gold, which streamed down like tears. He staggered back two steps and cried out, "Aiya!"

Li Ximing's face was pale, his spiritual qi rapidly draining. He was forced to recall the Divine Ability, freeing the three-eyed Merciful One. The _Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass_ in his hand was scorchingly hot. Seizing the opportunity, he sent his _Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire_ surging after the wounded Chiluo.

Chiluo had taken a direct hit at point-blank range. Not only were his arms destroyed and his radiance scattered, but his eyes were also seared by the Profound Light, tearing up uncontrollably as a wave of dizziness washed over him. Yet his reactions were incredibly fast. With no time to recall his pagoda, he managed to pull a round alms bowl from his waist and release its protective glow.

If his _Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption_ hadn't failed, Li Ximing would be in much better shape. Still, he smashed a ball of fire onto his opponent's Dharma Body, rallied his energy, and summoned his Divine Ability. _Audience with the Celestial Gate_ materialized once more and came crashing down.

Chiluo's alms bowl shot upward, ignoring its master's defense, and slammed violently into the bottom of the Heavenly Gate. The bowl, which must have been nourished for countless years, instantly exploded, releasing an intense, Searing light.

Chiluo's choice was undoubtedly the correct one.

After being caught off guard, he absolutely could not allow himself to be suppressed beneath the Heavenly Gate. If the empowerment from the Buddhist Land weakened while he was so severely injured, he might never escape. It was better to sacrifice the Treasured Artifact. Since the artifacts of Buddhist cultivators were generally inferior, there was a high chance he would never get it back if it was captured. Better to detonate it and prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

Chiluo was truly worthy of serving the Golden Lotus Seat. Even in such a dire situation, he made a series of perfectly correct decisions, instantly cutting his losses and even causing Li Ximing's Divine Ability to waver.

But in doing so, he left himself wide open. The unimpeded _Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire_ now poured down over him, exuding a terrifying, heart-stopping aura.
