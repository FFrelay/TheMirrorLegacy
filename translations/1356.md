# Chapter 1356: Shaping the Board

"The _Tiger’s Frontier Shamanic Profound Register_..."

Li Suining was momentarily speechless, and Li Quewan was likewise stunned—for from Lin Chensheng’s manner, it was apparent that this Daoist Master had brought the entire fortune of his mountain.

Yet Lin Chensheng only regarded them thoughtfully before speaking softly.

“Western Shu possesses countless divine abilities, and since Suyun has asked for my aid… I will, of course, not be stingy. It is merely a matter of us choosing carefully. However, I cannot bring this profound register into the great desert…”

He sighed, murmuring, “After all… this item must ultimately remain in the mountains. At worst, it may serve as a memento, so future generations remember what once belonged to them. Moreover, this register was always in the custody of the old temple master—even the Dao Lord never opened it. Daoist Master Houfu himself refrained from taking many of the treasures within, so it absolutely cannot be lost…”

Li Suining sighed inwardly, but Lin Chensheng said nothing further. He raised his hand, brought two fingers together, and brushed them lightly across the register. Golden characters flashed—and with a flick of his wrist, a white object appeared in his palm.

“This treasure,” he said solemnly, “please have Suyun examine it first. It would be best if it proves useful…”

The object was jade-white and solid, with sharp edges like a weighing stone. It was only palm-sized and seemed unremarkable, yet upon closer look, one could faintly see a golden radiance flowing within, suffused with a vigorous Whole Pill aura.

Li Quewan’s gaze fixed upon it instantly. She whispered,

“The Unharming Stone?”

“Precisely.”

Lin Chensheng smiled faintly. “This treasure hails from the Dragon Tiger Platform of old. It is said that before attaining his Dao, True Monarch Su De—Prime Virtue—had many companions. One such friend, a cultivator of heaven-defying ability, possessed an immortal pill and brought it for the True Monarch to observe. From it, the True Monarch fathomed its mysteries and refined three profound stones…”

He went on, “All three are priceless treasures, each with its own divine function.”

The black-robed Daoist Master sighed, lost briefly in recollection.

“Perhaps my words sound amusing to my fellow Daoists,” he said, “but the ancestor of our Lin clan once cultivated at the Dragon Tiger Platform. Only later did he pledge allegiance to that northern eminence and come to Tiger’s Frontier to establish our sect. He is the earliest traceable forebear of my family. It is said he had two fellow disciples—one surnamed Wang and one surnamed Qu—each of whom held one of the stones.”

“Later, one passed into the hands of the Golden Oneness tradition, and another was rumored to have entered the Numinous Treasure tradition. The one I possess here is among the few whose origin remains clear and traceable.”

Lin Chensheng paused, then continued quietly, “The true worth of this item lies in its influence over one’s life-mandate… The difficulty is that the secret art to activate it has long been lost. For generations, cultivators of our Daoist Tradition have inherited it, yet to them, it has remained nothing more than an ordinary object—none has ever succeeded in unlocking its power.”

The _Tiger’s Frontier Shamanic Profound Register_ was an extraordinary treasure. The spiritual artifacts within had been so well nourished that they seemed to carry the warmth of a cultivator’s hands, making the transfer of ownership remarkably smooth. Li Quewan took the Unharming Stone in her hand and swiftly began to commune with its mystical essence.

She gave it a gentle squeeze—and a wave of crystalline clarity washed over her mind. Her delicate fingers tightened as she felt neither rejection nor resistance. She simply nodded lightly.

“It is indeed a fine treasure.”

Lin Chensheng was unsurprised. Li Quewan’s cultivation method originated from the golden book of the Dragon Tiger Platform—if she _couldn’t_ activate it, _that_ would be strange. A brief flicker of envy passed through him, and he sighed inwardly.

_If I ever get the chance… perhaps I could trade for a copy of that golden book, to properly continue my Lin clan’s Dao lineage…_

But the golden book was far too precious. The thought faded as quickly as it had arisen, leaving his face calm and unreadable. He continued,

“I won’t elaborate on its minor mysteries. These three profound stones are of great aid in evading divination and can also nourish one’s life-mandate, shielding against various spell arts that affect the spiritual sense and consciousness.”

“If you refine it, you can use this treasure to mirror another’s life-mandate. Should that person be about to suffer harm, this Spiritual Treasure can bear the injury in their stead—so long as you’re within range…”

He paused and added gravely, “Likewise, if you employ this stone in performing shamanic arts or divine techniques, the person whose life-mandate it reflects will also share in the benefits. Its possibilities are boundless and wondrous.”

But Li Quewan seemed not to hear him, her gaze distant and unfocused.

_Holding this item, streams of cool energy rush through my mind… It feels somewhat like the Talisman Seed—but far gentler. How strange…_

Seeing her absorbed in the experience, Lin Chensheng smiled faintly and said, “The Unharming Stone is typically kept at the Shengyang Acupoint. It’s said that gathering all three produces a miraculous effect.”

His words seemed to snap Li Quewan from her reverie. She turned to look at him, but Lin Chensheng merely shook his head and said,

“After all, Quewan, you also possess the _Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity_. True Monarch Su De’s influence in those days was simply too profound. The vast majority of Whole Pill–aspected treasures were deliberately divided into three or five parts… I imagine you’re no stranger to that.”

Time was short, so Li Quewan thought no more of it. As she used her divine abilities and dharma power to nourish the Spiritual Treasure in her hand and familiarize herself with its essence, she asked softly,

“Among the Daoist Masters currently in Jiangnan… I wonder who else there might be, and whether they could come to lend their aid.”

Lin Chensheng considered for a moment before answering, “That will be difficult to arrange. Rumors of strange movements have already spread throughout the Southern Borderlands, and our allied mountain lords have requested assistance. We cannot spare many people. Only Daoist Master Jiuwen might be able to come. As for Old Daoist Master Chen, he has been beset by his own troubles—it’s impossible for him to leave.”

He paused briefly before continuing, “In the Jianghuai region, aside from Daoist Master Yang—who has returned to recuperate—there is also Daoist Master Jia Zan. He originally traveled north but was caught in the turmoil of the Mount Rao battle. The great general was disappointed and sent him back…”

_Yang Xuancai could still be useful,_ he thought, _but Jia Zan… better not to mention that name._

The mention of Jia Zan left Li Quewan unsure whether to laugh or frown. The old man had coasted into the Purple Mansion Realm on the strength of his family background and seniority. Though he shared close ties with her household, his ability left much to be desired. Now that he too was injured, if one were to gather all the Daoist Masters of Jiangnan and rank them, he would be at the very bottom.

_Now that Wushao possesses two Edict Pills, he could likely surpass that old man by a comfortable margin. If we actually called him here, he’d only hold us back. One careless moment and—dead with his last breath—and my family would be left to shoulder the debt…_

Still, he was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator no matter how weak, and Lin Chensheng was hardly lacking in fine treasures. Li Quewan said,

“It’s not out of the question to invite him. Let him remain hidden within the array. Choose a suitable treasure for him and let him help suppress the formation—it’s better than nothing.”

Li Suining lowered his head, a strange expression flickering across his face as the name settled in his mind.

_Jia Zan…_

The old man’s strength might have been lacking, but his fortune and instinct were extraordinary.

_When the war in the north broke out, everyone else was drafted into the front lines—yet he alone stayed out of harm’s way. He married a daughter to Qiao Yue, kept ties with my family, and managed to live out his years unscathed and content…_

Seeing Li Quewan’s brow knit ever tighter, Lin Chensheng finally spoke after a hesitant silence.

“There is one other candidate. His strength is considerable—he’s a well-known mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. The only issue… is that it would be difficult to mobilize him through official channels.”

“Who?!”

Li Quewan’s heart leapt at the prospect of more aid. Her voice sharpened with urgency as she looked at the black-robed man before her.

Lin Chensheng chose his words carefully.

“Guanghou.”

The Pure Unity Dao.

Daoist Master Guanghou.

Li Quewan hesitated, her expression wavering with indecision.

The position of the Pure Unity Dao was indeed a delicate one. In principle, the Great Song and the Pure Unity Dao were natural allies, with the latter serving as a vassal. The Yang clan had long sought to exert control over the Xi clan—but due to past grievances, the Xi clan had simply chosen to feign ignorance and silence.

Later, as the Yang clan’s pressure intensified, the Pure Unity Dao was compelled to send Daoist Master Guanghou to make an appearance at the Great Tomb River. Yet the Daoist Master gave them little face, seldom showing himself at all.

_However… the Xi clan and my family have always maintained a good relationship…_

After a moment’s thought, Li Quewan made up her mind and said,

“In that case, I shall compose a letter in the private name of my Li family. I will ask Daoist Master Jia to make a journey and see whether the Pure Unity Dao can spare someone to assist us.”

In truth, the Great Song still had that Sword Immortal—but he was deep in seclusion upon his mountain. All the great cultivators knew that ever since the Song Emperor had moved the capital, the Sword Gate had become the empire’s final line of defense. It had to remain guarded by the sharpest of blades—this was the Yang clan’s bottom line.

Otherwise, given the current power vacuum in Jianghuai, the forces of Mount Dayang might have already swept through and threatened the imperial throne itself.

Lin Chensheng spoke with her a while longer, then withdrew a purple talisman sealed within the register and handed it to her with solemn care.

“Daoist Master Suyun,” he said gravely, “this talisman is the _Profound Scripture Purple Register_. It shares its origin with Daoist Master Yuanxiu’s _Yellow Dao Profound Talisman_ and has long been kept hidden within this register. It is an exceptional treasure—but its use is exacting. Only one who possesses a Whole Pill can truly wield it. Daoist Master Sima once borrowed it for study over many years before reluctantly returning it. You should take a look.”

With that, he gathered up the profound register, offered a parting bow, and departed northward. He left behind a stack of purple talismans upon the table, each two fingers long and three wide. Li Quewan accepted them thoughtfully—but her expression shifted the moment she infused them with her divine ability.

To her astonishment, this item was no mere document but a fully awakened Spiritual Treasure, imbued with five complete divine profundities.

As she explored its resonance, the layered purple talismans suddenly stirred—fluttering open one after another like the pages of a living scripture. They leapt from her palm and danced through the air in a cascade of light, weaving around her slender fingers like purple butterflies.

She whispered under her breath, entranced,

“So this is the true heritage of the Supreme Yang…”

When the Li family first rose to prominence, it was during the waning years of the Supreme Yang. Daoist Master Kui Qi of the Great Owl Mallow Temple had stepped forward then; to maintain appearances, he offered a steady stream of spiritual essences and treasures. Li Ximing had been deeply moved at the time.

But looking back now, it was no wonder Kui Qi had been so generous, waving his hand so freely. To them0, those essences and pills were merely a drop in the ocean. Even with all the riches the Li family had seized from Luoxia, they could only match the Supreme Yang in general spiritual resources—falling short when it came to truly exceptional Spiritual Treasures.

_Kui Qi and the others... they merely used the treasures their own Daoist Tradition could command, and they still held that Supreme Yang treasure pouch feared by both north and south... What a pity they left no worthy successors..._

She suppressed the treasure’s activity and, after confirming that the Daoist Master had departed, turned to Li Suining. In a low voice, she asked,

“In your estimation, how many powerful cultivators dwell in the great desert?”

Li Suining answered at once, “At least five in the Purple Mansion Realm—three of them at mid-stage.”

The light in his eyes slowly dimmed. “That is the minimum. Western Shu also has a Heavenly Element user. While they may not be a major figure, there’s no telling what subtle moves they might make. There could be other variables—it’s not even impossible that they’ve already invited a Great Daoist Master in secret…”

Li Quewan was silent for a time as a dull ache formed between her brows.

_Even without a Great Daoist Master, we might still be hard-pressed to stop that group of experts— even with Lin Chensheng and me joining forces and relying on the grand array…_

Li Suining spoke hesitantly. “Daoist Master Cheng Qian… I’m afraid he cannot be moved.”

Li Quewan nodded. The pressure from the secret realm currently rested almost entirely on Cheng Qian’s shoulders; he could not be lightly withdrawn. She pondered for a moment, then said suddenly,

“There’s a demonic cultivator in the south—Daoist Master Luo. He has some connection with our family and is said to be taking refuge there now. Since Daoist Master Cheng cannot be moved, why not seek his help? I’ve heard his abilities are considerable—at the very least, he’s a middle-stage Purple Mansion cultivator.”

Li Suining’s eyes lit up. “Excellent!”

This man had been an obscure figure in his previous life and couldn’t even be counted among the Song State’s powers. Li Suining had only ever heard passing rumors of him and hadn’t thought of him at all. But Li Quewan, being a cultivator of real stature, knew her elders had dealings with him and had remembered instantly. The more he thought about it, the more sense it made.

“This Daoist Master Luo is a demonic cultivator forced into exile. The Song State disdains the blood aura that clings to him and refuses to employ him. He’s already looking to seize a quick fortune before fleeing overseas. If we offer a high enough price, he won’t fear making the journey—even in times like these…”

Hearing him speak with such detail, Li Quewan blinked in surprise. She studied him quietly, a flicker of amazement in her eyes.

_Heavenly Element… does it truly allow such perception? To read so clearly the thoughts of a rogue Purple Mansion cultivator across the continent—truly astonishing…_

He, however, did not notice her gaze. His eyes shone as he said,

“He may not fight with full devotion, but as you said, Daoist Master, he’s still a middle-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. So long as he stands with us, we’ll gain breathing room—even if the Pure Unity Dao declines to act!”

Though neither mentioned Li Zhouwei in the north, both knew the King Wei would never stand idle. All they needed to do was hold out long enough for the northern forces to break free.

Li Quewan rose to her feet at once. “I’ll go make the arrangements!”

She clearly intended to request aid from the Daoist Masters of Jianghuai, and she departed swiftly. Li Suining then began pacing within the cave dwelling, heart pounding.

_There’s still time… enough for Daoist Master Luo to arrive. If Western Shu also has a Heavenly Element user guiding them, they won’t strike early. To do so would only let King Wei withdraw before he’s entangled in the northern war…_

A glimmer of calculation flickered in his eyes.

_Protecting Daoist Master Lin is merely the worst-case scenario. We must also safeguard the grand array—and, above all, ensure Daoist Master Suyun remains unharmed…_

He had weighed the two in his mind many times. Li Quewan was unlike Li Jiangqian; that prince could thrive even if abandoned to fate. But Daoist Master Suyun was far too selfless—whether it was taking wounds upon herself or devoting time to construct secret realms, the burdens always seemed to fall on her.

_King Wei once said: “Changli is bold and unconcerned with trifles, while Suyun is prudent and self-restrained.” In every lifetime, she was never selfish enough, and always paid the price… Even now, Daoist Master Changli possesses two divine abilities and is moving toward his third, while she has yet to complete her second immortal foundation…_

Li Suining’s expression remained calm as still water, but within, his resolve solidified.

_She must not be severely injured. With my clan’s resources, even losing the grand array would not be crippling. At worst, we can use the spoils from the north to rebuild it anew. So long as we avoid being dragged into the northern war and King Wei returns, who would dare challenge our right to raise a spiritual array in the great desert?_

_And for a cultivator at the profound Whole Pill stage, each new divine ability marks a decisive transformation. Her progress must not be hindered further…_
