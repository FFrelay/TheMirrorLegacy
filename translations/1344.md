# Chapter 1344: Six Slips

His voice echoed through the empty hall. Enveloped in darkness, the sound seemed to travel somewhere deep and distant, echoing before the rows of spirit tablets.

"Cough, cough..."

Li Xuanxuan seemed to be listening for an answer. He bent his waist, extending a withered hand beneath the prayer mat. Exploring inch by inch, he retrieved an object and slowly held it steady in his palm. His ears were filled with the chaotic, relentless patter of rain.

The storm outside was growing more violent.

He slowly raised both hands until they were right before his eyes. Only then, in the dim gloom, did he see a speck of white. The object was thin and long, fragile as a cicada's wing—a jade knife.

In the pitch black, the old man first steadied the blade with one hand, then covered his face with his other desiccated hand. He traced up the thin skin until he found a small, peculiar protrusion.

He fixed the spot with his index finger. With the other hand, he took the jade knife and, with difficulty, began to carve into his own flesh.

Li Xuanxuan had no strength left. Fortunately, the knife was sharp enough. In years past, during the sacrifices, this blade had pierced the skulls of Foundation Establishment demon beasts with ease, let alone the skin of a dying, minor cultivator.

The withered skin was brittle as tree bark before the blade. A gentle pry was all it took to lift it, revealing a shiny, golden circular point.

Immediately after, the old man began to push upward with three fingers. In mere moments, the golden point expanded rapidly until it finally slid free from his flesh and fell to the floor!

_Thud... Thud..._

The crisp sound echoed in the hollow hall.

It was a golden bead.

The bead, the size of a medicinal pill and stained with blood, struck the prayer cushion before tumbling to the ground. It bounced with a *thump-thump* sound before quickly coming to a stop.

The protruding skin on his face instantly collapsed inward. His emaciated body, however, had no blood left to bleed. Li Xuanxuan swayed his body, raised his hand, and felt for the other side of his cheek.

_Thud... Thud..._

Another golden bead rolled onto the floor.

Years ago, when Li Xuanxuan was plagued by inner demons and unable to care for himself, Li Xijun had taken him far south to the Balanced Ritual Dao, where six golden beads were implanted in his body. The old man had secretly dug out two of them long ago, placing them neatly beside the prayer cushion.

Now that the two in his face had fallen, the old man felt a sudden sense of weightlessness washing over him. He slowly raised those ancient eyes. The all-too-familiar hallucinations that had tortured him in the past struck once more, accompanied by an overwhelming trance...

But he was no longer afraid.

He, Li Xuanxuan, was but the son of a farmer. His father died before he was born; he lost his mother in his youth; in his middle age, he lost his sons and grandsons. His life seemed to be one long farewell. Those long, arduous years, and all the sorrow and fear he had once held, would all be concluded today.

He tilted his head back. The sensation in his face was slowly fading, and the heavy darkness became absolute. He did not know if he had gone deaf or if the rain outside had stopped, but the sobbing and whispering voices vanished, leaving only a supreme tranquility.

The old man gazed out with piety.

He did not know how much time passed. The rain must have stopped, for the dark clouds no longer caged the heavens and earth. A glimmer of crystalline moonlight pierced through the treetops, shining into the high darkness. It shifted slowly, illuminating a line of text, character by character.

*Spirit Tablet of Late Father, Lord Li Mutian.*

_Thud..._

Next came the sound of a cane striking the ground. Li Xuanxuan saw it clearly now. In the darkness beside the altar sat a low stool. An old man was sitting sideways, leaning against the wall, turning his gaze to look around.

His face was full of wrinkles. Although he wore a slight smile, it could not conceal the ruthlessness that brimmed within. When those dark, grey-tinged eyes swept over him, the lips of the old man kneeling like a stone stele in the ancestral hall trembled.

Li Xuanxuan could never forget those eyes. Even knowing this was a hallucination born from gouging out the four golden beads, he stood frozen in place.

"Grandfather..."

But the old man merely watched him. Cold sweat broke out from Li Xuanxuan's exhausted body. He hurriedly picked up the jade knife and began feeling around his own heart.

'Right... there are still two... still two more...'

When he went to the Balanced Ritual years ago, the cultivator had driven six golden beads into his body: in his cheeks, his back, and his heart. He had removed the two in his back long ago, and just now the ones in his face. Now, only the two most dangerous ones remained!

The location should have been difficult to find, but he was simply too emaciated. Two round beads could be clearly felt at his chest. He spent a great deal of effort to cut open his collar, then drove the jade knife into his own chest.

_Thud..._

The golden bead was as cold as his body. It struck his robes, quickly rolled onto the floor, and trundled along a crack in the tiles until it was pinched by a large hand.

The man wore only rough hemp robes and had scars on his face. Behind his back hung the Azure Crow Bow. He looked like a hunter who had just emerged from the mountain forests. His eyes appeared calm, but the narrow corners of his eyes revealed a ruthless decisiveness. Smiling, he picked up the golden bead and held it quietly.

Li Xuanxuan’s gaze stiffened. His mind went blank, though he vaguely sensed people around him.

Another warm hand rested on Li Xuanxuan's shoulder.

The old man looked up—the newcomer had long, gentle eyebrows, gaunt cheeks, and broad shoulders. His dark grey eyes stared quietly at him.

Behind him stood a young man, his expression steady, a sword on his back. He seemed to regret leaving the world too early, staring at Li Xuanxuan with guilt.

Only then did the old man hear a very soft, very light sigh.

"Xuan'er."

Li Xuanxuan had not heard that name in a long, long time. He used to hear it constantly in his youth, even if the words often made him tremble with fear back then.

'Xuan'er... still lacks decisiveness...'

'Xuan'er won't make it to Foundation Establishment in time...'

'Xuan'er, how is the situation on the lake these years?'

But at the end of his life, when those two syllables rang out, he began to whimper silently. He gripped the jade knife tightly, unhesitatingly tore open the other side of his chest, and gouged roughly.

_Thud... Thud..._

A cold sensation slid past his hand and struck the ground again. More figures flickered before his eyes.

Beside the hunter with the bow stood another man, dressed in white, cradling the Qingchi sword in his arms, his handsome face full of smiles.

The old man felt a faint touch at his hand. A pale, sickly youth was kneeling beside him, lifting his hand with great heartache. Beside the youth stood another man, tall in stature, eyes bright and filled with wisdom, staring straight ahead with hope.

Only a gloomy young man in black walked swiftly past him from behind, standing sideways in the rear with his head lowered, lips pursed, seemingly unwilling to look at him.

More figures stood in the darkness. A man cloaked in thunder with burning eyes; a handsome youth holding a cold blade; a gentle, silent woman; and his wife and daughter kneeling quietly behind him.

And then there was that one person, walking out of the darkness to stand before them all.

He looked so young, no more than thirty years old. Li Xuanxuan thought... he might not even be thirty. That face had nothing sharp or strikingly handsome about it; it was simply very gentle. Holding a scroll in his hand, he stood in the distant darkness, looking at him with a smile, separated by the crowd.

Li Xuanxuan had never met him.

His father.

Li Xuanxuan clutched the knife, kneeling in a trance. He wanted to stand, but his body was pushed beyond its limits. He staggered a few times and fell back into a sitting position. Yet all the gazes remained fixed on him—some gentle, some majestic, some expectant, some reverent...

In the hazy moonlight, in the final fantasy of this life, the old man finally lowered his head. His gaze shifted, slowly moving to the small object beside him.

It was a bamboo cup, filled with command tokens acting as divination slips, emitting a bright glow under the moon.

The old man extended his withered hands, gently picked it up, and cupped it in his palms. He shook it with difficulty. As the cluttered bamboo sticks collided and slid against each other, one fell out.

This slip was but a palm's length and a finger's width. On the front, written in black ink:

[ Son of Long Prefecture ]

The four words were written somewhat hastily, seemingly an old tune. It lay face up, resting quietly on the ground.

Li Xuanxuan stared with shriveled eyes. He reached out to take it and turned the slip over. On the back, written in vermilion paint over green, were five words.

[ Affinity of the Reed Marsh ]

These five words were incredibly graceful, their colors vivid, possessing a profound mystery that seized the soul. He let go and slowly shook the bamboo tube again. Amidst the crisp collision sounds, another slip gently fell to the floor.

This slip landed with its blank back facing up.

The old man reached out, pinched it with two fingers, and turned it over. Under the clear moonlight, he read the three words on this slip.

[ Expelling the Vicious ]

The strokes of these three characters were extremely sharp, as if intended to pierce through the back of the wood. Every character seemed carved by knife and axe. Who knew how much heroic blood, how much injustice and sorrow, were painted into a single word?

He gasped for breath and looked up, realizing the figures in the distance were gone. His father, who had stood in the hall, had also departed. Only that warm hand remained on his shoulder.

The old man gently put down the slip and shook the tube. A few more crisp sounds from within, and a slip fell to the ground, again landing face down. Li Xuanxuan extended his withered fingers and flipped it with force. The three words in the front:

[ Purifying the Universe ]

He realized the warmth of the hand on his shoulder had vanished long ago. The strength that had held up his sleeve was also gone. The space beside him suddenly felt empty, a chill that made one shudder.

Li Xuanxuan lifted his head, breathing heavier. He wiped the bloody foam from his lips, clasped his hands tight, raised the bamboo tube, and shook it ceaselessly. The bamboo stick caught on his robe, flipping as it hit the ground.

[ Reaching the Dawn ]

These three words were clearly black ink, yet for no reason, he saw a hint of gold in them. The colors shifted, resembling the radiant sky over the lake...

Li Xuanxuan dared not look up. He only dared to shake his hands to seek the slips. Hearing the crisp sound of bamboo, he saw it land blank side up again. This time, it landed head first, its tail resting on his knee.

He picked it up gently, turned it with two fingers, and saw the two words on the slip.

[ Fullness Palace ]

The three ink characters flashed, and he seemed to see that brat's silhouette again. That playful, smiling face was still before his eyes. Below his feet, heads bobbed in a crowd, congratulations boiled over, and a noisy, bustling tower was erected.

How festive.

"Cough, cough..."

He felt only a spicy burning in his throat and could no longer care about anything else. He casually set down the bamboo stick, cupped the tube with both hands, and shook it with trembling fear. Amidst the crisp collisions, that one specific slip finally drifted to the floor.

This one seemed to be checked often, so much so that the bamboo body was worn smooth by touch. It hit the ground lightly. The old man recognized it in an instant, but still unwilling to give up, he struggled to lift his eyelids. Moving his gaze inch by inch, he saw the bloody, slightly blurred three characters:

[ Lament for the Fleeting River ]!

He was naturally not surprised. He merely let out a painful gasp from his throat, raised his hand to cover his lips, and coughed violently. Every cough caused the wounds on his body to spray droplets of blood, dyeing his robes in speckles of red.

_Thud!_

Li Xuanxuan finally collapsed to the ground. A violent impact came from his face; the side that hit the floor went numb, and he vaguely felt a wetness. As the world spun, he saw that there was nothing beside him. Just an empty void. The lamp was out, the rain had stopped. It was as peaceful as the moment he had knelt down.

He lay on his side on the ground, his grey eyes staring quietly at the slip in his hand. In this instant, he moved his two fingers with difficulty and gently flipped the slip over.

Just like his first slip, there were words on the back of this final one. The old man's vision was blurry, yet he could clearly see those three small, blood-shimmering words.

[ The Recent Usurpation ]

These three characters reflected a faint red in his pupils. The old man's clenched jaw slowly relaxed. He exhaled a long, slow breath from his lungs.

The ancestral hall plunged into greyness once more.

_Drip._

The sound of fine rain began to rise again, coming from afar to near, quickly turning into a rapid *drip-drip-drop-drop*. Then came the thunder, swiftly evolving into the urgent sound of rain smashing against the eaves like a pipa being strummed.

_Boom!_

The blurred world finally returned. The urgent, dense sobbing, the uneasy whispered exchanges, the light footsteps constantly circling in front of the hall—all converged into a soothing noise that gently scratched at the human heart.

_Bang..._

The jade talisman hanging on the table shattered with a bang, turning into dense powder that poured down and scattered across the floor. Almost simultaneously, the doors to the ancestral hall creaked open.

Cold wind whistled in.

What Li Ximing saw was the figure of his grandfather collapsed on the ground. His body was twisted, one side of his face pressed coldly against the floor. It made Li Ximing's entire body turn ice-cold, and he took a dazed step forward.

_Rumble..._

Something rolled across the floor. A golden bead rolled all the way to his feet, colliding with them before coming to an abrupt halt. Li Ximing slowly closed his eyes, clear tears flowing down.

_Thud!_

He fell to his knees with a thud. Touching the old man's withered, broken cheek with his hand, he discovered that Li Xuanxuan was clutching something tightly, as if he had used all his remaining strength.

And scattered beside him was a jade knife.

Li Ximing recognized this knife. Years ago, when the family was still destitute—whether it was Li Tongya or Li Xuanxuan—they had all used this knife for sacrifices...

As his robes swept across the floor, the golden beads rolled across the ground, the sound distant as they collided with a *ding-ding-dang-dang*. Li Ximing lowered his brow, looking at the bloodstains on the knife and the hand Li Xuanxuan held tight.

The Daoist Master very gently extracted the slip from his grandfather's grip. He held it in his hand without looking at it, his lips trembling slightly.

He could not bear to look any longer. He raised his head, turning his face away to look at the younger generations who had stopped before the hall. His voice was gentle, as if afraid to disturb the old man before him.

"Prepare the funeral."
