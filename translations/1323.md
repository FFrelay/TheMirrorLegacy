# Chapter 1323: The Profound Vault

Night stretched endlessly onward.

Within the Great Void, colors dimmed as various radiances submerged into the murk. Several streaks of light interwove as they sped urgently eastward, skimming over patches of land below where sutras were chanted everywhere—a scene of complete tranquility.

The distant horizon blazed entirely gold, as if some great phenomenon was unfolding. Golden figures stood ranked across the sky, enforcing strict watch over all four directions.

"Lotus Temple... what madness has seized them..."

Qiao Wenliu showed some hesitation, his gaze lingering on the earth below as he said,

"King Wei must exercise caution... The Way of Joyful Bliss has always been cunning, and that Maha Jinlian—I've heard of him. he is a master of sophistry, a shameless character who possesses a treasured candle lamp that can track one's movements. Although he's already departed for the north... that thing has likely been left behind in the temple. With Mount Dayang watching from the side as well, it won't be easy for us to pass through..."

Li Zhouwei clasped his hands behind his back while secretly forming seals for the Spirit Probe technique. With complete awareness of movements throughout the entire region, he showed no concern. He merely smiled and shook his head. Watching the southern mountains gradually emerge in the distance, he asked,

"The southern gateway... is it Mount Rao?"

"Correct."

Knowing he had confidence, Qiao Wenliu immediately said no more and instead continued,

"Mount Rao is also a major stronghold, guarded by Zhao Dezhi of the Abundant Stability Gate. This man is famously meticulous and prudent. Back when he met with those from the grotto-heavens, everyone remarked that his heart was set on seeking the Dao, his gaze unwavering. He was one of the rare few who cultivated for ten years before descending the mountain..."

"Moreover..."

He pondered for a moment, but King Wei was already shaking his head,

"This place may not have only him alone."

Qiao Wenliu quickly nodded in agreement.

As Li Zhouwei's Spirit Probe circulated, he had already discerned the internal layout of that towering mountain from afar. How could there be only some Zhao Dezhi? The divine abilities within stood in strict battle formation—no less formidable than the Yun and Pu passes!

He sneered inwardly, 'They've certainly learned of the events on the Ji River in Gu Prefecture, and they know Yan Kingdom will soon cease interference. They've made their calculations—nearly half their divine abilities are guarding the south, waiting for me to collide with them.'

Yet Li Zhouwei did not linger on this. His gaze swept casually over the fortified city before leading the two onward to the east. Qiao Wenliu felt secretly curious. Being an extremely perceptive individual himself, he thought,

'He is going to the eastern gateway!'

Gu Prefecture occupied the central plains leaning eastward. The western gateways of Yun and Pu barriers were locked in iron defense, while the northern gateway was the renowned High-Peak City!

'The place where the Zhaowu Emperor fell.'

'And also...'

At this thought, he couldn't help glancing at King Wei.

'Where the Qi clan of Qi Lanyan resides.'

Needless to say, the divine abilities at that barrier would absolutely fight to the death without surrender. Facing Yan Kingdom as well, it was naturally impossible to grasp that burning-hot problem. Though the southern gateway of Mount Rao seemed vulnerable, King Wei was perhaps being cautious, making a great detour straight toward the eastern gateway...

'This means traversing the entire territory of Lotus Temple—not gambling that they won't create difficulties, but treating them as if they don't exist at all...'

He clenched his teeth, though even greater worries filled his heart.

'This is an enormous gamble... Gu Prefecture's eastern gateway is Mount Jiao. Though this mountain is far inferior to the other two directions, the Way of Great Desire lies nearby with strong intentions to intervene. If we cannot swiftly overcome the eastern gateway and get cut off by divine abilities from the south, with such distance from Dangyin, we could very well lose everything...'

He contemplated at length, thinking it would be better to gamble on Mount Rao having fewer forces—at least the losses would be lighter. But not knowing what trump cards this King Wei held, he refrained from objecting and followed silently.

Li Zhouwei, however, turned his head and looked down at Liu Changdie.

"Elder Yuanbian, have you completely mastered that item?"

Liu Changdie trusted him more. Opening his tightly closed eyes, he spread his palm to reveal densely packed, storm-like tiny silver cones swirling within. Concentrated lightning brewed among them, as if ready to erupt at any moment.

The Stormshatter Wedges!

This supreme treasure of Azure Pond had been brought by Sima Yuanli early on and was now in the hands of Liu Changdie, this grandmaster of formations. Without exaggeration, among all divine abilities in Jiangnan currently, none were more worthy to wield this item!

Li Zhouwei glanced at it before speaking directly,

"Elder Liu, I wish to swiftly conquer Mount Jiao. I've heard Mount Jiao is a sacred ground of Horn Wood, with formations representing the pinnacle of Horn Wood arts. Elder, possessing the profundities of dual Metal elements and being a grandmaster of formations, do you have any insights?"

Qiao Wenliu had already been startled by that lightning object, but hearing these words left him stunned.

'This unassuming man is actually a formation grandmaster? Jiangnan has never had any great formation tradition from ancient times to now—what kind of abilities does this person possess...'

'Also, what does "possessing the profundities of dual Metal elements" mean... Dui and Geng?'

Yet he said aloud,

"I've seen that great Horn Wood formation. It conceals a Wandering Metal. Radiant Fire and Geng Metal aren't so fearful of it..."

Liu Changdie, however, reacted extremely quickly. After brief consideration, he said,

"I see. In my view... to break this Horn Wood, using Merging Fire would be most suitable!"

Merging Fire's tyranny ranked among the finest in all the world—which Dao lineage wouldn't feel apprehensive upon encountering it? Qiao Wenliu likewise nodded in agreement, and Li Zhouwei added

"Items of Merging Fire... we truly have too few in hand. Apart from an ancient Spiritual Treasure touched by traces of Merging Fire, I possess only one stream of Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire..."

This ancient Spiritual Treasure was naturally the Divine Dan Purple Gourd, originally in Li Jiangqian's hands but requisitioned by Li Zhouwei before departure. As for the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, that was a matter from much earlier.

When Li Zhouwei achieved the Imperial Observation of the Origin, this divine ability—being the Imperial Pivot Observation of Dharma Realm—took the meaning of light pervading the cosmos. While this technique could harmonize all Bright Yang methods, allowing him to suppress all cultivators, this wasn't its only function.

'After all, once Imperial Observation of the Origin unfolds, it extremely abhors failure. If it had only this one effect, it could only suppress lower cultivators. Upon encountering opponents of the same level or even stronger enemies, Imperial Observation of the Origin would appear utterly useless...'

Yet this divine ability was actually two sides of one whole—it could also be held internally within one's body for combat against powerful enemies!

'When deployed externally, it's called the [Bright Emperor's Observation of the Origin]. When held internally, it becomes [Observation of the Three Yangs].'

Observation of the Three Yangs signified that Bright Yang ranked among the Three Yangs, holding a revered position with command over fire. It was, among the Bright Yang, the supreme expression of Fire Virtue's mysteries, second only to the Bright Yang Purple Fire of Heavenly Audience Gate.

Li Zhouwei had actually known this extremely early. Years ago when attacking Luoxia, Li Ximing had wanted to give him the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire. Li Zhouwei's refusal then, telling Li Ximing to wait until Imperial Observation of the Origin was completed before claiming it, was precisely for today!

Before going to the Great Tomb River, he had actually retrieved the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire. However, whether it was Su Yan, Tang Jiyu of Dangyin, or even Qiao Wenliu before his eyes—none of their divine abilities matched his. To put it bluntly, not one was qualified to make him hold Imperial Observation internally!

Hearing his words now, Liu Changdie stroked his beard thoughtfully and said,

"Liu believes... it's sufficient."

Seeing both men look toward him, he continued,

"I possess the Profound Vault Invitation Letter. I can perform a spell or two to draw lightning from metal. Coupled with the Stormshatter Wedges, lightning and fire will intertwine. No matter how good the formation is, it cannot withstand such an assault..."

The expression on Qiao Wenliu's face froze solid.

"Profound Vault Invitation Letter?"

"A Vault Metal cultivator?!"

As if discovering some heaven-shaking treasure, he even brought forward his hands that had been clasped behind his back, reaching out as if beholding some heavenly material or earthly treasure, grasping Liu Changdie's hand as he exclaimed in shock,

"What need is there for lightning and fire? If Fellow Daoist Liu can connect to the Profound Vault, between you and me, where would we lack Merging Fire Spiritual Treasures?"

His words were sudden, but Liu Changdie seemed to understand, covering his face in some embarrassment as he said,

"Liu's divine ability and Dao-Profundity are inadequate—my strength falls short..."

Information about Vault Metal was truly too scarce. Even someone as erudite as Qiao Wenliu appeared to have touched upon unknown territory. Puzzled, he said,

"So it also involves one's divine ability and Dao-Profundity... I'd only heard that anyone who could connect to the Profound Vault was extremely formidable..."

Seeing Li Zhouwei's gaze turn toward him, Liu Changdie sighed and explained,

"King Wei may not know, but the Profound Vault Invitation Letter is no ordinary Spiritual Treasure. Its true applications are extremely broad. To summarize in one phrase: it connects to the Profound Vault... This Profound Vault was originally an item of the great Encompassing Profundity Dao. I've heard it was once used by Immortal Lords to verify the Great Dao. Later, it gradually came to be used by Divine Cores and even lower cultivators. Within it exist various profundities—all manner of Spiritual Treasures, spiritual items, and even divine abilities..."

"High-level cultivators of the Vault Metal Dao can use material items as collateral to borrow from within... As long as one maintains it with divine ability, when the appointed time arrives, both sides will naturally settle accounts."

"Such a thing exists!"

Li Zhouwei had long heard that Vault Metal Spiritual Treasures were extremely formidable, but never imagined they were miraculous to this degree. Somehow, he thought of his own Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Yet being ultimately perceptive, he said,

"You mean... use our own Spiritual Treasures to exchange for several Merging Fire treasures?"

His eyes brightened as all his thoughts opened in an instant. He said,

"If Elder Liu possesses such abilities, that would truly be... astonishing!"

Liu Changdie gave a bitter smile, sighed, and said,

"That this treasure possesses such profundities—Liu actually knew this. Even Daoist Master Qiao... you underestimate this treasure. This treasure can exchange for more than just Spiritual Artifacts... Our predecessors rarely used it to borrow Spiritual Artifacts or Treasures—they used it to... exchange for divine abilities!"

"Divine abilities?!"

Qiao Wenliu started in surprise. Reacting extremely quickly, he said in amazement,

"Using your Vault Metal divine ability as collateral, you can exchange for other divine abilities?"

Liu Changdie pondered, "In principle, this possibility exists. Ancient high-level cultivators who held the letter could fight this way—borrowing an ability for a fight and returning it afterward. But my cultivation is too low, sealed early on. Despite numerous attempts, I've never succeeded. Thus I delayed, not daring to tell King Wei. Only in recent days did I finally stabilize it... yet... yet."

He shook his head.

"The item that is exchanged for is beyond my control."

This statement made both men pause. Liu Changdie said bitterly,

"Precisely because of this, I've long refused to use this item. What if what gets exchanged is a Merging Fire divine ability? Metal and Fire clashing, especially the most toxic Merging Fire—without anyone else taking action, I'd injure myself and forced to withdraw first!"

He sighed, finally showing some relief in his eyes.

"Furthermore, without certain Dao-Profundity, how can one smoothly employ another lineage's divine ability... These years without a cultivation path, I've devoted all my thoughts to this treasure, merely refining it to the point of smooth deployment—at least I won't injure myself due to incompatible abilities."

Li Zhouwei seemed thoughtful, finally understanding Liu Changdie's words by the lake. Suddenly sensing something unusual, he said,

"Elder Yuanbian, when you use this to exchange for Spiritual Artifacts, is it true that the higher the material's rank and quality, the more formidable the exchanged item?"

"Precisely!"

Liu Changdie nodded.

"Essentially, it still relies on the nature of Vault Metal. The exchanged item must be slightly inferior to what's put in for the Profound Vault to tolerate it for an incense stick's duration..."

Li Zhouwei's heart leaped. With a wave of his sleeve, he produced an item—an exquisitely bound scroll.

The Huai River Map.

This item was naturally formidable, ranking highly among treasures in Li Zhouwei's possession. However, like the Pure Yang Bracelets, its effects were singular rather than complex. Now that Imperial Observation of the Origin had been achieved, this item's miraculous ability somewhat overlapped.

This didn't mean the Huai River Map wasn't powerful. Holding this item could at minimum suppress one of an opponent's Spiritual Treasures—definitely not to be disdained. Rather, Li Zhouwei had taken note of one of its excellent characteristics.

Personally crafted by the High Radiance True Monarch!

He smiled, "When battle commences shortly, take this item and test it—see what good things can be exchanged as collateral. I'm not even demanding Merging Fire—Fire Virtue or Metal Virtue would be best. Even if neither, as long as the quality is sufficient, it will certainly prove greatly useful!"

......

Mount Jiao.

Mount Jiao stood in eastern Gu Prefecture, overlooking Qilu in the distance. Because a high-level cultivator of Horn Wood had verified the Dao here many years ago, the forest flourished luxuriantly, green surging skyward.

Upon this tall mountain stood two figures.

One wore flowing white robes. Appearing quite aged, he smiled while stroking his beard, watching rolling flying blossoms across the mountain, seemingly extremely pleased. Unable to restrain himself, he clasped his hands behind his back and strode forward with a laugh.

"Young Friend Lu, what do you think of these flowers and grasses of mine... how are they?"

The person opposite him was considerably younger, with a long beard floating past his cap, simple cloth shoes, and the appearance of a gentle middle-aged man. Yet between his brows seemed considerable melancholy. Even the beautiful scenery before him couldn't attract his attention. He merely said,

"Excellent indeed!"

The elder glanced at him, then led him striding past the sea of flowers to take seats in the great hall, saying,

"Young Friend Lu's mind is restless!"

The middle-aged man shook his head with a bitter smile.

"In the end, I've lost face for the clan. Though defeat at his hands is no disgrace, there are inevitably some in the prefecture who lack depth of understanding. They think that being born of the Lu clan should mean dignity and being unmatched—so they look down on me..."

This person's entire body shone with Metal Virtue divine abilities, his bearing outstanding. He was actually one of the two captives Li Zhouwei had taken alive at Luoxia—Lu Fu!

He had suffered serious injuries back then, spending time recovering in the grotto-heaven. But not long after, seemingly unable to endure the gossip within, he had emerged again on his own.

These words made green light flash in the elder's eyes as he shook his head with regret.

"Dignity? In matters touching the interests of great personages, who cares about our dignity? You and I sit high in contemplation—do we care about the dignity of those Qi-Gathering cultivators below? All divine abilities understand clearly... It's just those petty cultivators in the grotto-heavens who lack sense, gossiping in private."

"Although I am of high status, everyone in the grotto-heavens has connections to divine abilities. I cannot punish them over idle words—I cannot control them. If they wish to gossip, let them gossip!"

The melancholy between his brows grew even denser. With a long sigh, he said,

"Now I hear fighting has broken out in the west again. Unlike them, I've already witnessed King Wei's imposing presence. Though Fellow Daoist Pang is certainly clever, he cannot oppose the will of Heaven."

His mention of 'will of Heaven' carried profound implications—whether referring to the vast unknowable fate, the irresistible momentum sweeping across the realm, or a certain 'Heaven' that hung high in the sky. The old Daoist Master, however, understood clearly, but sipped tea without speaking, listening as his junior continued,

"I simply won't get involved with them—I've come to your place, elder, to avoid it all..."

The elder shook his head.

"Sooner or later, it cannot be avoided."

Lu Fu also sipped his tea with a self-mocking smile,

"I feel no shame, but that doesn't mean I must put my ear up to listen. First let them also taste bitterness—save them from calling me cowardly. The grotto-heavens are full of noise. Hiding far away suits me fine..."

His mood improved somewhat as he laughed,

"King Wei is in the west, I'm in the east. Could he possibly cross a thousand li to capture me again and throw me in that Heavenly Nurture Urn of his?"
