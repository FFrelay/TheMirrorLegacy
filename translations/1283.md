# Chapter 1283: Lost Matters

Li Ximing extended two fingers, and the flame clung to them like lacquer, climbing up in well-behaved tendrils. The smile on the white-gold-robed Daoist Master gradually widened as he watched the young man take out a robe the color of solar crimson clouds.

Li Jiangqian said solemnly,

"This belonged to the late Daoist Master of Wei-Li. This junior just examined it; it uses Bright Yang as its base and refines Virile Fire, and most rare of all, it still contains a wisp of Supreme Yang qi, making it quite unusual. I brought it here for Great-granduncle to see."

Li Ximing looked it over from top to bottom and could not help but nod, saying,

"Items of Supreme Yang are exceedingly rare these days. This robe must have had one or two portions of Supreme Yang spiritual resource mixed in during its refinement..."

He shook his head and smiled,

"Since your father left no instructions for it, you should just take it for your own use."

Li Jiangqian quickly shook his head.

"This junior is unworthy. Great-granduncle already yielded the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument to me, and now the Divine Dan Purple Gourd is also mine; how could I possibly accept this robe as well? I will simply have someone refine it and send it to you, Great-granduncle."

He did not wait for Li Ximing to speak, immediately continuing,

"Dealing with the rewards for the various Purple Mansion Realms... is actually quite a time-consuming affair. I have many Radiant Fire items on me; I'll take a few to exchange first and see what news I can gather."

'It's not just about him spending time to refine it. When the time comes for him to go north, I'll have to give it to him anyway, so there's no hurry.'

When Li Ximing heard this, he sighed and did not argue the point.

"The pill is completed ahead of schedule, so I can go to the north to have a look... I am still worried about Senior Liu..."

Li Jiangqian smiled and shook his head, saying,

"Great-granduncle, you spend all day refining pills, so you don't truly know his capabilities. With two Vault Metal divine abilities, plus a unique Vault Metal Spiritual Treasure, even if a Great Daoist Master swallowed him whole, he wouldn't be able to get him down. And if he forced it, his neck would be stuck stretching two li long..."

Seeing him joking, Li Quewan let out a laugh and shook her head, saying only,

"Golden Oneness is reliable. Rest assured."

The young man stood with his hands clasped behind his back, pondering for a moment, but it was Li Quewan who spoke up,

"In the comings and goings of these past few months, this junior has already examined that Profound Foundation art that King Wei found."

As she raised this matter, Li Jiangqian’s gaze grew profound, while Li Ximing remained silent. The mountainside instantly fell quiet. Seeing that neither of them intended to elaborate, Li Quewan continued,

"Right now, we have quite a few Pure Qi spiritual items on hand. Beneath the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda, there is a Celestial Roaming Rampart Stone; the newly obtained Scattering Cloud Treasured Qi... and that portion of Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance."

Her expression was solemn.

"The foundation of a Secret Realm lies in its Pure Qi. The more precious the Pure Qi used for the Profound Foundation, the more abundant the realm's spiritual vitality and the vaster its domain. But it is precisely this Pure Qi that is so difficult to find, which is why good Secret Realms are so rare."

"The Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance was differentiated from the utmost extreme of yin; if not for this, it would have been impossible for us to find such a precious Pure Qi item. The Celestial Roaming Rampart Stone was a gift from Daoist Master Yuanxiu back then. In the end, only the Scattering Cloud Treasured Qi was something we acquired ourselves, which was somewhat unexpected..."

She gave a bitter smile and continued,

"But the Scattering Cloud Treasured Qi is frankly not of high quality. Although it is touched by a bit of ancient Treasured Qi, which makes it seem special, it is precisely because it is tainted by Treasured Qi that its effect for establishing the Profound Foundation will be poor."

"Based on my estimations using the Profound Foundation secret art, if we use the Scattering Cloud Treasured Qi, we will at most gain a domain of one or two peaks, with spiritual vitality merely on par with the North Shore."

Li Ximing understood her implication and said,

"So we must use the Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance."

The Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance was a top-tier sacred healing medicine that even had the wondrous effect of adding spiritual apertures; keeping it was naturally for the best, but Li Quewan merely nodded silently and quickly said,

"But if Great-granduncle is willing to use the Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance, we will gain a domain of at least one city and one mountain, no worse than those few great families in Luoxia! More importantly, the spiritual vitality will be dense..."

"If we were to use the Celestial Roaming Rampart Stone, that item is tainted with a bit of Wandering Metal, which actually makes it suitable for creating a Secret Realm. The size wouldn't change much, but the spiritual vitality would be far inferior."

Li Jiangqian pondered this, then asked in a low voice,

"What if we use all three?"

Li Quewan's expression turned serious.

"Naturally, the more the better. If we use both the Stone and the Lotus, we won't need to rush to expand the domain too much. There is a reason why the Secret Realms of the great families are mostly maintained at the size of a single city and mountain; the spiritual vitality is more concentrated, and at the same time, it greatly lessens the burden on the Profound Foundation, helping it resist various fluctuations in spiritual vitality. The Scattering Cloud Treasured Qi might even transform into a treasure peak within the realm... Furthermore... if one day..."

She hesitated slightly before continuing,

"If one day, the spiritual atmosphere of Jiangnan is no longer the Vast Profound Suspended Void, the Secret Realm will once again require maintenance. When that time comes, a smaller burden on the Profound Foundation will lessen the pressure on our descendants..."

"Of course..."

Li Quewan said awkwardly,

"The Pure Qi is only the core of the Profound Foundation. If we decide to use all three Pure Qi items, the corresponding costs will also increase significantly; by twenty or thirty percent at the very least..."

The Li family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators possess the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, which has low requirements for spiritual vitality. But a Secret Realm is truly different from the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance; that is a place that lesser cultivators, and even outsiders, can enter!

Li Jiangqian smiled faintly and replied,

"I recall... Suining also has a secret art for connecting to the Profound Foundation, does he not? Will this be affected?"

Li Quewan said, "Speaking of that, if we had a Heaven-Governing spiritual item to refine into the Profound Foundation, it would be best for him. Unfortunately, Heaven-Governing spiritual items are practically extinct, exceedingly rare... However, the more stable the Profound Foundation is, the easier his refinement process will be."

Li Ximing listened for a while and, at that moment, made up his mind.

"In that case, we will not skimp on this Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance!"

"Yes!"

The two replied in unison. Li Quewan took another jade slip from her sleeve and said solemnly,

"This junior has already made the calculations. If we do this, we will still require at least five Purple Mansion-level spiritual items and at least twenty types of various Purple Mansion spiritual resources. The materials below the Purple Mansion Realm needed will be a massive quantity. The manpower and materials required to harmonize all these spiritual resources will be incalculable..."

She continued,

"A specific list cannot be provided, as it will depend on observation during the refinement process to add or subtract. If the lead is insufficient, we add; if the mercury is excessive, we remove. Water and fire must balance each other, bringing yin and yang into equilibrium..."

Li Ximing felt a headache coming on.

"This is truly a massive undertaking."

Li Quewan, however, revealed a slight smile.

"But there is some good news."

The two looked toward her, and Li Quewan continued,

"With the Art of Demoting Yin, we can make great use of the various yin aspects demoted from the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance for harmonization. This is a top-tier Supreme Yin spiritual resource with great utility, allowing us to achieve twice the result with half the effort. I will only need to add the yang components."

She said softly,

"If we add the Qi Moon White Dew left over from the demotion of yin back then, it will be nearly perfect. This means the required amount of Purple Mansion-level materials can be cut in half!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He pinched his fingers to make a quick calculation and said,

"Does that mean only two or three spiritual items, and ten spiritual resources?"

Although the Li family currently had nine spiritual items free, four of them were Radiant Fire-aspected, the Pure Qi items were now allocated, the Three Primal Mercury had to be saved for Li Quewan, and the remaining Heavenly One Pure Origin could not be touched lightly. For a time, only the Horn Wood and the Radiant Sky Stone were available.

Li Jiangqian nodded and said gravely,

"The Radiant Sky Stone is an item of three-yang, making it most suitable. Among the spoils from Luoxia, there was also a Horn Wood spiritual item from the Yang family, and we just obtained a Converging Water spiritual item. Among the Radiant Fire items, we have the Yin Divination Li Branch. These all happen to be items of radiance. I will hand them all to you first; it should be enough to start!"

"The Radiant Fire items... King Wei already promised them to Elder Brother..."

Li Quewan hesitated slightly, but the young man before her began to laugh,

"You are spending your precious cultivation time to refine the Profound Foundation while I can cultivate wholeheartedly; I am already in your debt. What more needs to be said!"

He waved his hand to stop his sister's words and said gravely,

"We must take these things and exchange them far and wide as soon as possible, to trade for spiritual resources useful for harmonizing the Profound Foundation, so that we do not waste too much time."

Li Quewan could only nod. Li Ximing thought it over carefully and still felt a pang of regret,

"Our family is now definitely considered wealthy in Jiangnan; we have a share of Secret Realms and grotto-heavens alike, and we even annexed Luoxia. If it is still like this for us, I can only imagine what it's like for other families..."

Li Quewan made some careful calculations, put the items away, and smiled,

"This junior will establish the Secret Realm's connection point to the Great Void within the inner formation in the lake!"

She was decisive, teleporting away immediately. Li Jiangqian also rose and said gravely,

"Since all miscellaneous matters are handled, this junior will now consume the spiritual item to aid in cultivating the divine ability, March of Peace!"

Li Ximing watched him depart. As the mountain peak grew quiet, the Daoist Master casually put away his pill furnace, pondered for a moment, and fished a jade slip from his sleeve, its surface flickering with golden patterns.

The Northern Emperor's Scripture of Wei.

'Imperial Observation of the Origin... or Sovereign Treading Peril?'

He rubbed it for a time, staring at the brilliant golden patterns as the light in his eyes flickered. After a long moment, he finally placed the jade slip on the table, an expression of careful deliberation on his face.

...

The mountains were covered in heavy snow, and the forest wind howled.

Since the Xiao family's departure, the Lixia region had completely lost its voice in Jiangnan. It produced no talents worthy of note, making it inferior even to the Mushroom Forest Plains.

The departure of Mount Xianyou, in particular, had left an ugly scar upon the land. Earth veins leaked, and desolate yin winds blew. Due to the Xiao family's long years of suppression, where they had clipped the wings of all rivals, this land had no Daoist traditions to speak of. Having also been ravaged by the Way of Great Desire, it was a thousand-li wilderness; fertile soil lay untended, to say nothing of such a blighted place.

Fortunately, it was the depths of winter, and a heavy snowfall had covered the scar, making it seem less frightful.

An old man approached from the west, treading step by step through the snow, delving deep into this land. His figure swayed, but his gaze was calm. He walked until he was deep within the snowfall, only then stopping to speak softly,

"Fellow Daoist Yang!"

His voice echoed in the heavy snow, sounding hazy and indistinct.

After a long moment, a faint sound was heard. The snow seemed to fall even heavier, blotting out the sky and sun, to the point that the entire land turned pitch-black, sinking into a darkness where one could not see one's own hand.

"Fellow Daoist Xiao, I trust you have been well."

Amidst the white snow, uneven traces finally appeared as a dense blackness swept in, coalescing into a figure.

This person's skin was extremely pale. He wore a heavy cloak, and purple talismans drifted about him. His entire body was shrouded in shadow, yet behind him was a round radiance, emitting a hazy purple glow that cast colorful arcs of light.

Xiao Chuting did not turn, merely standing as he was. A smile touched the corners of his lips as he said quietly,

"As of today, this Xiao finally has the qualifications to speak with you face-to-face. Unfortunately, Mount Xianyou is gone, so I cannot play host to you, Fellow Daoist."

The black-robed man paced to his side and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with him. He gazed at the heavy-falling snow, his tone remote and placid,

"There is nothing to host with. I am unaccustomed to the things of your mortal realm."

'Your...'

The arc of Xiao Chuting's smile faded. He turned slightly to the side, his expression complex.

"So you have been enlisted into the Underworld. Congratulations, Your Excellency."

The man stood with his hands clasped behind him, a faint chill entering his tone,

"I am merely a minor Merit Officer, hardly worth congratulating. You, on the other hand..."

His gaze, which shone with a dark light, held a rare trace of complexity.

"If you can succeed, Fellow Daoist, _I_ will have to call _you_ 'Your Excellency'. The brightness of your future is something we yin shades could never hope to match."

A note of sarcasm entered his voice,

"Are you not afraid, Fellow Daoist?"

"Afraid of what?"

"Verifying the Dao without borrowing from the Profound Nature, seeking the Gold without seeing the spirits... If this were ancient times, people like us would have no right to even see you. Are you not afraid, Fellow Daoist, that prolonged contact with me will obstruct your path to the Dao?"

The old man took a step forward and said,

"Your Excellency is a yin shade, and your Exiled Qi is potent. How could you obstruct me?"

He smiled, "Besides... Your Excellency doesn't believe I can succeed, either. Otherwise, it would be you visiting the Northern Sea, not me returning to Jiangnan."

Merit Officer Yang did not rush to deny it, but turned to look at him and said softly,

"This Yang is clear about his debts and grudges. Since you helped me with Duanmu Kui's matter back then, I repaid you greatly while I was still in a human body. After I entered the Underworld, I severed all contact with you. Seeing you again now is only because a few last strands of mortal destiny have yet to be cut."

Xiao Chuting smiled.

"Since you are here to sever mortal destiny, perhaps Your Excellency could enlighten me on one or two questions?"

The Merit Officer shot him a cold glance—the yin shade's eyes seemed eternally icy and dark, devoid of any trace of emotion.

"If it involves a True Monarch, then do not bother asking. You are a man on the verge of verifying the Dao, so you act without fear. I, however, do not possess such a grand destiny that I can presume to comment on the schemes of a True Monarch."

"I am not asking about a True Monarch!"

Xiao Chuting's smile slowly faded.

"I am asking about the Dragon Monarch."

These three words were like a bolt of lightning that split the mists between heaven and earth. They seemed to connect to something, only to be suppressed by an infinite darkness. Merit Officer Yang's expression remained calm; he simply said nothing.

The old man's eyes gradually brightened, and his speech suddenly quickened.

"Back then, Dongfang Rijiu transferred the Boundless Ocean to ascend to the main position. He later perished, and the main position passed on, eventually ending up in the hands of the current one. But I have searched every scripture and cannot find a single word about it; after all, it was a Golden Core-level affair..."

"But his seizure of the Fruition Attainment must have left a trace."

"I searched high and low, but all I found was this single phrase passed down by my Xiao family ancestors: 'The Life Flood Dragon travels the waters, the Exhausted Yu seizes the abyss, the Mansion is imprisoned within the Pit, all converges in the Lord Monarch'."

"Since ancient times, fewer and fewer people have attained the Dao through Mansion Water. There must be a reason! The Pit Water generates overflow and grows ever stronger; this must be related to the dragons."

"As soon as this Xiao leaves Jiangnan, I will go north, and there will be no more restraints. Your Excellency need not worry. I only ask one thing!"

"The Converging Water seizing the Monarch... was it related to the fall of Dongfang Tianye back then!"

His voice was deep and forceful. The question seemed abrupt, yet it made the Merit Officer fall silent. But whether he answered or not, the old man before him already understood everything from his reaction.

"More than once."

Xiao Chuting began to laugh:

"That's it. Back then, this Converging Water Dragon Monarch was merely copying his elder brother, and that was how he was able to seize the main position of Converging Water!"

"How does a Dragon Monarch ascend to a Fruition Attainment? There must be some great merit, and this merit cannot be small. It could only be by continuing to push the Mansion Water into the Pit, making the main position increasingly similar to Converging Water... This must have happened at the end of the Qi and the beginning of the Liang."

This Merit Officer seemed to grow interested, looking at him with a smile:

"And how do you know this?"

"The Liang Emperor slew flood dragons and subdued phoenixes to manage the waters and establish his dynasty. Throughout the Liang dynasty, the water disasters were particularly severe."

Xiao Chuting said quietly,

"Those floods were precisely because the Pit Water was overflowing more and more! Is that not so?"

The figure in the darkness remained silent, not answering him. The old man laughed,

"The Exhausted Yu seizes the abyss."

"It is 'seizes', not 'receives'... Relying on a single Converging Water entity alone would likely be insufficient to accomplish this. Since it says 'seizes', there must be a 'Yu' of the Pit Water. And above the Pit Water, there is someone else—one in an Intercalary Position, correct? Cooperating with the Converging Water Dragon Monarch, using that Intercalary Position to either verify the Dao or change the Dao, pushing the Boundless Ocean deeper into the Pit Water... and thus attaining the Dao."

"This is the reason why, after Dongfang Rijiu's fall, the various Dragon Princes fought endlessly, bringing chaos to the world! They needed to incite ambitious warlords to enact change, so _He_ could attain the Dao, allowing the Dragon Monarch to ascend to the main position! This is also why the Lord of Cangzhou grows weaker and weaker!"

"And right now... if this Lord of the Pit Water Intercalary Position is still in this world, he must also be waiting for me to verify the Dao. He is waiting for me to open the Great Tomb River, hoping to remove the Lord Monarch of the Pit and take a share of the profits from me..."

His smile vanished, and his gaze turned icy cold.

"What I must face, perhaps, is not just those two."
