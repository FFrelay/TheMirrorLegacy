# Chapter 1299: An Old Acquaintance

Li Qinghong's voice was clear and carried a hint of a smile, causing Li Quewan to hastily raise a hand to her cheek to catch hers, only to find it terribly cold, lacking the warmth of a living person.

She shook her head and said in a low voice, "It's been many years!"

Li Qinghong's expression was complicated and she remained silent, while Li Jiangqian hurriedly stepped forward, bowed, and said,

"Back then, when Senior rescued Great-granduncle in the outer seas, the family knew nothing of it. It was only when Father returned from the Thunder Pool that we learned the happy news… Now… now we must rely on Senior once again!"

His gaze was intense, and he seemed quite moved.

Both times Li Qinghong had taken action, she had faced figures at the Great Daoist Master level; back when Li Ximing fled to the Eastern Sea, she had only just advanced yet still acted decisively, relying on the Thunder Pool to rescue Li Ximing from right under a Great Daoist Master's nose!

Yet now, after merely a few decades, her strength seemed capable of suppressing a Great Daoist Master; how could Li Jiangqian not be moved by this?

He sighed repeatedly, listening as Li Wushao said with a laugh.

"Milady is still the most impressive, beating him until he was dizzy and disoriented, begging for mercy again and again…"

These words, however, made the woman laugh, and she said,

"Even if I hadn't intervened, Chiguang wouldn't have troubled you. That man is desperate in his quest for seeking the Dao and is no ordinary figure."

Li Jiangqian's words broke the heavy atmosphere, and Li Qinghong's hazy purple eyes paused on his golden pupils for a moment before she brought her other hand from behind her back, casually tossing an object into Li Quewan's arms.

Li Quewan caught it with both hands and looked closely. It was pitch-black with intricate, diffuse silver patterns—it was indeed the Iron Edict Elixir!

The object finally lay quietly in her palm; it was no more than two fingers wide, its dark luster flickering constantly as if breathing, and it seemed to have sensed the aura of the other Iron Edict Elixir on her body, the two now resonating with each other.

The Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity corresponded to the five Dao lineages within the Prime Virtue doctrine—what were now known as the Three Shamans and Two Rites—and although she had not refined the object, a powerful aura washed over her, giving her an insight:

'This is an Iron Edict Elixir of the Merging Owl Dao!'

This supreme treasure seemed as insignificant as a pebble in front of the spirit cultivator, but Li Quewan had no time to examine it closely, looking excitedly at the person before her as she bowed and said,

"Many thanks, Milady!"

Li Qinghong laughed, then once again flipped over an ink-black object in her palm, saying,

"You get a share, too!"

Li Jiangqian was overjoyed and hurried forward, taking what she handed him into his palms; he found it was an object about three fingers wide, resembling a small snake, and seemed to be a Valley Water treasure, as its aura was exceptionally well-concealed, though just holding it told him the material was far from ordinary.

He laughed and said, "We all know how formidable figures like Suiguan and Dongfang Heyun are; I was just thinking that our family has one too!"

Li Qinghong seemed slightly distracted, as if sensing something, but upon hearing his words, she shook her head and said,

"That's not a good comparison. The Borrowing of external Profound Mystery naturally has different levels, and Suiguan and Heyun are the foremost in the world, so you can't compare to them. This Chiguang is actually quite capable himself. If he truly intended to fight, I wouldn't have had an easy time killing him in this grotto-heaven. But he didn't want to be injured by me, nor did he dare to injure me, so his hands were tied."

Li Jiangqian, however, secretly drew in a sharp breath.

'Chiguang's name resounds through the north, and he's hailed as a genius of the Immortal Dao, yet for her, it was merely _not an easy time killing him_... If Milady's strength is already this tyrannical, then how many divine abilities and skills must the likes of Suiguan and Dongfang Heyun possess!'

"This item of yours… was originally obtained by Chiguang."

Li Qinghong took a step and said softly,

"I came here on a mission and couldn't act rashly, but he bumped right into my hands, so he can only count himself unlucky…"

She shook her head slightly.

"Since it wasn't easy to kill him, I figured I shouldn't offend him either. He didn't dare harm you and he offered up a treasure, so I withdrew my thunder and said I'd accept the favor, though there's no need to believe in such pleasantries—all that matters is that we got the item."

Li Qinghong's slender hand waited in the air for a moment before a streak of purple-white light sped over, only transforming into the small, white-flower-adorned hairpin as it drew close, landing obediently in her palm.

She pinned up her dark hair and said casually, "He didn't look back and he's already gone far."

So the small hairpin had given chase to monitor Chiguang and had only just returned.

Li Quewan nodded silently at this scene, but the old Demon, by contrast, was very worried and said,

"I fear he has lost face and harbors resentment."

"Harbors resentment?"

Li Qinghong gave a dazzling smile.

"On this, you are mistaken. Anyone intent on the Quest for Gold and achieving the Dao has certainly cast aside life and death, to say nothing of honor and disgrace? If it doesn't benefit the Quest for Gold, a hundred lifetimes of glory are useless. If it can resolve an obstacle on the Dao, any myriad of humiliations is like sweet nectar. Furthermore, our family's Minghuang grows more impressive by the day. Fighting due to the circumstances is one thing, but harming you is another matter entirely, and the two cannot be conflated."

An edge of cold severity entered her smile, and for an instant, that gentle expression seemed as bright and terrible as lightning.

"If not for that, how could I have let him escape so easily this time."

Li Jiangqian nodded in deep agreement as Li Qinghong's bright eyes swept over the two of them. Surprisingly, she didn't ask about Li Zhouwei, but instead inquired softly,

"Ming'er… how is he?"

Li Quewan, having composed herself, smiled and said,

"Great-granduncle is doing very well. He has cultivated two divine abilities to perfection and is about to start on a third, and his pill arts are superb. I'm sure Milady has heard word of it even in the outer seas!"

"Two divine abilities... that is rare.", Li Qinghong said quietly. "He has lived up to expectations. If my elder brother and younger brother Ping know of this in the afterlife, they will certainly be at ease."

This question seemed to be merely a prelude. She now took a deep breath, showing a touch of anxiety like one returning home after a long absence, and murmured,

"Eldest Uncle… how is his health? Calculating the days…"

At these words, Li Jiangqian shifted slightly, and the light in Li Quewan's eyes also dimmed as she answered hesitantly,

"He was in poor health for the past few years, and the Daoist Master searched everywhere for life-extending remedies for him, which helped him look better for a time. But time passes in a flash, and this year his health failed again. We asked the old master's wishes, and he... does not want to extend his life further."

Li Qinghong's lovely, willow-leaf brows furrowed slightly, and she said in a hoarse voice,

"Eldest Uncle has always been frugal. How can you just let him have his way!"

Li Quewan pressed her lips together and answered,

"He stays in the ancestral hall day after day and refuses to see us. Before the year's end, Uncle Zhouming finally managed to see him and brought the matter up again, and he said... he said..."

"He remembered many old things, and thinking of how well the family is doing today, he is anxious to report the good news to the ancestors, and doesn't want life and death to stand in the way."

Li Qinghong immediately fell silent and turned her head away. Only after a long moment did she seem to make a decision, saying,

"Then… then let him be."

The three humans remained relatively restrained, but Li Wushao couldn't bear to hear this and turned his back to wipe away tears, while Li Qinghong quickly composed herself, sighing inwardly.

'It's a pity this isn't the place for a long talk, nor is there time for one. The various divine abilities have already dispersed, and I cannot let my personal feelings delay the opportunity for these two.'

She thus deliberately turned back and said with a smile, "You're certainly quick-witted."

Li Jiangqian understood she was referring to him breaking the seal and helping to ease the atmosphere, so he smiled and said,

"I saw the signs earlier and thought it might be Senior Dongfang Heyun, considering the relationship between our two families. I never expected it would be Milady who came! If I had known… I would have broken it much earlier and saved all this trouble!"

Li Qinghong smiled without speaking, and just as expected, they saw the watery mist roil on the horizon as a faint voice instantly emerged, resounding by their ears—a voice that was refined, peaceful, and held a hint of a smile.

"What kind of talk is that!"

Sure enough, a person had already appeared beside Li Qinghong. He had thin eyebrows, large eyes, and neat hair and beard, with his hands clasped behind his back and a wide smile on his face. His inhuman eyes were vivid with emotion as he spoke,

"Even if it were I who came, how could I mistreat the Young Master? That Chiguang would still be sweating bullets and fleeing for his life!"

Dongfang Heyun!

This scene was extremely bizarre, occurring entirely beyond the spiritual sense of cultivators. The Li siblings had anticipated this and didn't react strongly, merely bowing hurriedly, but it frightened Li Wushao so much that he cried "Aiyo!" and dropped to his knees, saying,

"Greetings… Mi… Milord!"

Li Qinghong smiled and said softly,

"Heyun, you are too modest. Figures such as us were attendants to gods and aides to immortals in ancient times, with the most powerful ones being called Divine Cores. Our strength is inextricably linked to our foundation. Suiguan was formed from the Azure Profundity's marvelous law when Pristine Water True Monarch achieved the Dao, and you are the cloud-qi from when the Dragon Monarch achieved the Dao—both were born of that achievement. I, however, am of the thunder-swallowing ilk, my foundation reliant on the Dragon Monarch's cultivation advancing, so I am naturally inferior…"

Dongfang Heyun looked eagerly at the two before him and said with a laugh,

"Though you say inferior, you also possess vast divine abilities. It's just that your strength is difficult to advance. Currently, Converging Water is primary, with cloud as master and thunder as auxiliary, but True Dragons are meant to accumulate both cloud and thunder. Sooner or later, you will be my equal, and when the True Dragons achieve their path… you and I may not lack for a position as a Divine Core!"

"Divine Core…"

Li Jiangqian swept his gaze over him but didn't look too closely, showing no arrogance as he said politely,

"This humble cultivator has only heard of the Woven Jade Immortals. Perhaps that is what this Divine Core is…"

"They can't compare!"

Dongfang Heyun hadn't expected him to mention Woven Jade and couldn't help but laugh,

"One, no matter how high, is still a spiritual being. The other, no matter how low, is still an immortal…"

The smile on Dongfang Heyun's face seemed polite but also somewhat cynical. He brought his hands forward from behind his back and suddenly turned his head, appearing extremely interested in Li Wushao, looking him up and down, and discerning his origins, he said,

"Curious… curious… you and I are actually cut from the same cloth."

Li Wushao had seen the wider world and usually had his share of shameless moments, and now he had even achieved a divine ability. Logically, he shouldn't have lost his composure, but for some reason, he was trembling as he knelt on the ground, opening his mouth several times but unable to speak.

Dongfang Heyun suddenly said, "You—you've seen that Suiguan, haven't you?"

As soon as he said this, Li Jiangqian's heart clenched. Li Wushao hesitated and shook his head, but a faint light gleamed in Dongfang Heyun's eyes as he said,

"What's there to be afraid of? I'm not going to eat you!"

Although he said this, a rare, sharp light entered his eyes as he pressed, "Where did you see this person… what did he look like?"

Li Wushao had indeed seen him back then. The original memory had been forgotten due to a divine ability, but later, his life-mandate was elevated and merged into the Spiritual Treasure, reawakening those memories. He could only answer in a low voice,

"That person came to the north shore back then, carrying out matters arranged by the True Monarch. He wore azure robes, and had narrow eyes and long eyebrows…"

Dongfang Heyun listened for a moment and sneered, "Still the same appearance."

Li Qinghong sighed inwardly.

She had spent a fair amount of time with Dongfang Heyun. This spirit cultivator seemed nonchalant, but he was actually extremely attentive to all arrangements regarding the Dragon-kin, and having lived through the contention of the nine princes, he utterly detested the Hooked Serpent. His current demeanor could already be considered polite.

She immediately shook her head, interrupting, "Your business… is it handled?"

Dongfang Heyun immediately looked up, turning sideways, and said with a smile,

"It's done… it's done! That man from the Touba family actually had some spine. I took his heart and gouged out his eyes, and he still dared to curse me loudly… You know my temperament, I can't stand hearing such things, so I couldn't help... tormenting him for a little while longer."

Li Quewan frowned secretly, but Li Jiangqian had personally witnessed that scene, and his heart trembled.

'Touba Ci has fallen!'

In truth, Touba Ci and the Li family had no significant relationship—neither a great enmity nor any deep gratitude—but Touba Ci was a genius in his own right, and he was the very first enemy Li Jiangqian had fought after breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm!

This direct descendant of the Touba family had given the then-fledgling Li Jiangqian quite a shock. The man had once commanded vast armies in the Dai state, cultivated extremely quickly, possessed a considerable reputation, and could be counted as a renowned general…

'Dead, just like that… and to suffer such an end…'

A chill crept into his heart for a moment, and he lowered his gaze, saying nothing. Dongfang Heyun, however, seemed completely unfazed, and Li Qinghong turned her head to say,

"Since that's settled, let's not delay further. We must head to that place, or we'll be late and miss Daoist Master Xiao verifying the Dao."

Dongfang Heyun's gaze swept back and forth between Li Quewan and Li Jiangqian before he finally nodded after a long moment. Li Qinghong looked back at the two and said,

"A thousand li east of here, there is another region. Head there, and you should meet quite a few people. That old Daoist Master from Golden Feather has already gone ahead…"

Her gaze held a trace of reluctance as she said softly, "You must be careful!"

The moment her voice fell, she transformed into a streak of lightning and vanished. Dongfang Heyun seemed even more reluctant to part, his gaze lingering slowly on Li Wushao before he finally dissolved into a cloud of mist, a sheet of shimmering, iridescent light.

The cloud-mist ascended rapidly, streaking across the sky like a bright comet, and amid the distortion of the surroundings, the youth's figure faintly reappeared within the cloud.

Dongfang Heyun's eternally polite smile and calm gaze finally fluctuated violently. An extremely dense gloom flashed in the depths of his eyes as he anxiously smoothed the ends of his hair, seemingly grinding his teeth:

'Hooked Serpent? A Hooked Serpent with a divine ability… and it's seen Suiguan… _Huu_… Suiguan… Pristine Water… They went to the lake? They couldn't have discussed something, could they… A scheme? A plot?'

His eyelid twitched slightly as he neurotically straightened his appearance over and over, meticulously folding his collar and cuffs time and again.

'It can't be… It's been so many years, Converging Water is already ascendant, and Valley Water is also complete. How could the prophecy be empty words? After sacrificing so much… after losing so many Dragon Princes and descendants… how can it be empty talk! It can't be…'

As the scenery blurred and shifted, he heard a woman's gentle voice, tinged with confusion,

"Fellow Daoist Heyun!"

This spirit-cloud, who never made mistakes, had almost flown past their destination. He awoke with a start, the myriad emotions in his eyes instantly coalescing into infinite killing intent, which was just as quickly concealed beneath a calm facade. He immediately manifested his form, looked down at the great hall below, and said with a grin, teeth clenched:

"Fellow Daoists, quickly flee for your lives!"
