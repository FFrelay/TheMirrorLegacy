# Chapter 4: Li Yecheng

"Eldest Uncle, spare my life!"

The man was terrified out of his wits, beginning to beg for mercy the instant he landed, hugging Li Mutian and curling into a ball.

"Ah! Spare me, Eldest Uncle, spare me! Eldest Uncle, spare my life..."

Li Yecheng had never imagined that just by wanting to steal a melon to satisfy a craving, the Eldest Uncle he feared most would appear before him in the blink of an eye, frightening him motionless. To make matters worse, Li Mutian was holding a long blade in one hand, which nearly scared him to death.

"Yecheng?" Li Mutian stared intently, his brows furrowed tightly and his expression uncertain as he stroked the beard on his chin, gazing fixedly at him.

Li Yecheng was Li Yesheng's older brother; their father had been bedridden for years, yet Li Yecheng spent his days idling about, constantly mooching off others.

The two youths also heard the commotion and hurried over; Li Tongya lifted his long staff and pressed it directly onto Li Yecheng's arm, frightening him so badly he was weeping profusely.

Li Changhu lifted his head to get a look and could not help but falter.

"Cousin?" Li Changhu let out a long breath, his voice laced with confusion.

"Why are you here?" Li Tongya asked coldly, the pressure from his staff unwavering.

"He came to steal your family's melons!" Seeing Li Yecheng's stammering, Li Mutian answered for him with a cold face, sheathed his long blade, and turned to leave.

"Cousin, my apologies."

Li Tongya also retracted his strength and lifted his staff, tossing out the words before following his father back into the house.

Only Li Changhu remained; he helped Li Yecheng up, wiped his face, offered a few warm words of comfort, and politely saw him out of the courtyard.

————

Inside the house.

Li Chejing and Li Xiangping sat blankly by the table, the mirror hidden in Li Xiangping's robes, who dared not move a muscle; fortunately, it was not long before their father and Second Brother walked into the hall.

"Where's Eldest Brother?"

He looked behind them and asked hurriedly.

"Seeing the guest out."

Li Mutian shook his head.

"I know that child Yecheng often comes to mooch, but I am terrified that word of tonight's events will leak, bringing annihilation upon our entire family."

Li Tongya found a small stool and sat down; hearing this, he turned his head to look at Li Xiangping, just about to speak.

"Creak."

The main door creaked shut, and Eldest Brother Li Changhu entered with a look of confusion, sat down on a stool, and spoke to his father, Li Mutian.

"Father, why was that necessary?"

He shook his head.

"Yecheng was only stealing a single melon. Instead of doing him an easy favor, you insisted on offending his family."

"What 'his family,' 'my family'? There is only one Li family. We are the main branch; they are the side."

Li Mutian leaned against the window, turning an ear, and beckoned to his wife and youngest son.

"You two go wait by the front and back doors. Call out if anyone comes."

The two agreed and exited; Li Mutian turned to shut the doors and windows tightly, then patted Li Xiangping and said,

"You speak!"

Li Xiangping nodded vigorously and began to speak in a tiny voice,

"Today I went to the Meichi River to catch fish, and I found something in the water."

After speaking, he looked at his father, Li Mutian, and seeing him nod, he pulled the mirror from his robes.

Li Changhu looked at his younger brother, then at his father, and took the greenish-grey mirror, but after close examination, he could not see anything unusual about it.

Li Mutian took the mirror from his eldest son's hand, found the small hole in the roof, moved a stone stool, and placed the mirror directly beneath it, squinting at his two sons.

They watched as the moonlight rippled like water, then converged above the mirror's surface like fledgling swallows returning to their nest, revealing a faint, white, gem-like halo.

Li Changhu shot up from his chair with a "swish," staring fixedly at the halo on the mirror; Li Tongya also paled, his expression moved as he gazed thoughtfully at the object.

For the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the Li family members stared silently at the mirror without a word, their expressions varied.

This was already Li Xiangping's second time seeing this sight, but he was still shocked and pale, muttering to himself,

"I've never seen such a beautiful sight in all my life..."

"Haha, forget you; even your old man, I, have never seen such a fine thing."

Li Mutian chuckled lowly, but there was no mirth in his eyes; on the contrary, they were ruthless.

"This is likely an immortal's artifact."

Li Tongya spoke quietly, picking up his long blade and wiping it incessantly; he stared at the mirror, appearing calm, but his constantly trembling hand betrayed his inner turmoil.

"If word of this leaks, it will be the calamity of our family's extermination."

Li Changhu paced back and forth in the hall, his expression a mixture of anxiety and excitement.

"If this is an artifact an immortal lost, and they use a spell to search for it tomorrow, how should we conduct ourselves?"

Li Tongya stared fixedly at his father, speaking with considerable worry.

Li Xiangping nodded, his gaze lowered as he said in a muffled voice,

"Whatever the immortal rewards us, our family will benefit endlessly."

"Nonsense."

Li Mutian waved his hand, "I have heard that many immortals are murderous. Absolutely not! This mirror has been in the water for who knows how long; if they wanted to retrieve it, they would have long since taken it. How could it fall to mortals like us? I believe that immortal has most likely already met with misfortune."

These outrageously treasonous words made Li Changhu's heart tremble with fear, and he frowned, lost in thought.

Li Tongya, however, came to a sudden realization and spoke in a low, heavy voice,

"Could it have been seen by that kid, Li Yecheng?"

"I showed the item to Father in front of the house. Cousin Yecheng should have been in the fields at the time." Li Xiangping said, his gaze downcast.

"I'll go kill him!"

Li Tongya's expression turned ruthless; he unhesitatingly threw on his rattan armor, grabbed his blade, and started to walk out. It was the first time Li Xiangping had ever seen such a look on his brother's face, and he could not help but stare.

"Come back!" Li Mutian frowned and stopped Li Tongya, shooting a glance at Li Xiangping that made him look flustered.

"Father!" Li Tongya finally grew anxious, his tone forceful as he spoke.

"Li Yecheng is a fickle and faithless person, arrogant and unrestrained, and he betrays his own family. Rather than let him misspeak and leak the news, bringing disaster upon our Li family, it is better to let him die first."

'It seems Second Brother learned a lot from the village teacher.' Li Xiangping thought silently, lowering his head in shame; Father had sent the three of them to study back then, and both his older brothers had earned the teacher's favor.

Only he had been young, ignorant, and mischievous, and now he could not even understand the idioms in his brother's words.

"Then what if your youngest brother was disloyal and had a loose tongue? Would you kill him too?"

Li Mutian laughed heartily, questioning his second son.

"Our family has no such coward."

Li Tongya said faintly.

Li Mutian shook his head, righted the wooden table with his hand, and with a light leap, he landed onto the table and retrieved a wooden box from the roof beams.

Placing the wooden box on the table, he spoke with a serious expression to the three brothers before him,

"There are some things I should let you know. I left home at thirteen and followed the Guli Dao into Anli County. General Yang had received orders from the imperial court to attack the Eastern Yue and was implementing the Guli Dao conscription; at that time, your dad, I, had nowhere else to go, so I had to become a soldier. General Yang was strict in managing the army, but he also ate and lived alongside us, as if we were family. He passed on the Yue soldier battle techniques to us and told us to practice martial arts well. This battle technique is widespread, easy to learn but difficult to master; an ordinary person who learns it merely becomes more agile, showing no divine or unusual qualities."

Li Mutian sighed, and seeing them all listening intently, he continued,

"After I returned home, I studied and wrote, transcribing the battle technique onto this wooden slip. I have already had you all practice it carefully, and even now, it doesn't seem to amount to anything. That is the first thing."

Li Mutian opened the wooden box. Inside lay a wooden slip, a talisman, and a few miscellaneous items like scraps of silver and glazed glass.
