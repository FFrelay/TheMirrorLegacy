# Chapter 1357: Dao Heritage

"His name is... Li Ximing?"

As dusk settled over the mountains, two figures stood at the end of a bluestone path. One man was seated astride a large stone, while the other stood beside him with his hands clasped behind his back. Hearing the question, he replied,

"Yes, he should be of the same generation as King Wei's grand-uncles..."

"He's quite young, then."

The man sitting on the stone stood up, straightened his sleeves, and gazed at the splendor racing across the horizon as he spoke casually,

"Fellow Daoist Lu... but in my view, not counting King Wei and his son, the Li clan has only produced two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in two hundred years... which is actually quite few, hardly befitting the title of Bright Yang imperial descendants. As for that other Li clan in the Ning State... they are also a far cry from it."

Lu An turned his head slightly, shaking it with a smile.

"It's hard to say! Even among imperial descendants, how many are true paragons? Once they reach shallow waters without the support of resources, they may have to fight tooth and nail just to survive. To produce two is already commendable..."

"As for the Ning Li..."

He pondered for a moment but had no time to answer, for two Daoist Masters had already landed nearby, one after the other. The one in the lead had a point of light on his brow and a focused, solemn expression. The man following him appeared far more unrestrained, his body roiling with a golden energy that was potent yet contained.

Lu An stepped forward, and introduced himself, "Fellow Daoist Zhaojing! I am Lu An."

He paused before stating formally, "Of the Lu clan, of the Six Palaces of the Numinous Treasure Order, in service to the Comprehending Profundity Great Dao!"

Lu An was naturally feeling pleased with himself. In this great shift in the grand scheme of things, his Lu clan had emerged completely unscathed and had even fostered many good relations. He carried an air of effortless grace, a stark contrast to the resentful figure he had been years ago.

Li Ximing, who had rushed over from the west with a mind full of calculations, hurriedly replied,

"The great renown of the Lus, Zhaojing has long heard of it!"

Lu An turned and pointed to the man behind him, smiling.

"This is Daoist Master Yu from Gaoping[^7]. His Daoist title is Zunxian[^8]. He only arrived in the prefecture a few days ago, and you could say he has a certain destiny with your Li clan!"

Li Ximing took a closer look. Daoist Master Zunxian had an extraordinary bearing, nodding with a faint smile and an air of transcendent worldliness. The feathered robe he wore billowed in the wind, as if he might spread his wings and take flight at any moment.

Given the precedent with Fu He, the choice of who to send to greet him had surely been a deliberate one. Li Ximing played along, smiling as he asked,

"Bright Yang?"

Daoist Master Zunxian shook his head and replied with a smile,

"I cannot claim any connection to the imperial line. I am merely a rogue cultivator from Outside the Profound, without a formal path or tradition. I humbly cultivate in Gaoping, and my Dao heritage is the Flying Monarch Shangmiao of Soaring-Beyond. My ancestor... was named Yu Feiqing..."

'A cultivator from Outside the Profound?!'

Li Ximing had seen very few cultivators from Outside the Profound. After all, in the current age, which cultivator did not try to align themselves with the Three Profundities? Those rogue cultivators with some renown, be it Su Mian or Changxi, all tried to polish their own reputations...

Noticing his surprise, Zunxian smiled.

"My ancestor's master was the Flying Monarch Shangmiao of Soaring-Beyond, and he was the sixth disciple. His third disciple-brother's secular name was Li Hengqing. He came from the Bright Yang lineage and achieved a Surplus Position of the Supreme Yin..."

"So it's the Ning Li!"

A peculiar look crossed Li Ximing's face as his mind began to race, and he sighed with a hint of guilt.

"That is truly a distant connection... My family has no record of it whatsoever..."

Zunxian replied softly, "If Bright Yang is still considered close, how can the Soaring-Beyond be distant? That lord dual-cultivated with a spirit maiden, and their descendants ventured out, leading a branch of the lineage forth from the Origin Mansion. That is how the great Jiangbei Li clan came to be. Their Supreme Yin dharma lineage and bloodline come from the Flying Monarch, so they can be considered half-descendants of the ancestral master..."

This was, of course, mere pleasantry. After all, from all appearances, the Li family showed no miraculous signs of a sacred lineage. At most, they were descendants of Li Hengqing's contemporary clansmen, possessing the name but not the substance. If Zunxian truly felt such a connection, he should have visited long ago. Why wait until today?

But the underlying implication was worth contemplating.

'Back then... when old Daoist Master Yuanshang of the Pure Unity Dao passed away, he once explained the origin of the Ning Li to me. They descended from a figure who had perfected the Supreme Yin under the rogue Immortal Wu Che...'

'And now, according to him, not only is the Ning Li's paternal line from a True Monarch of the Surplus Position, but their maternal line is actually descended from the daughter of that same rogue Immortal Wu Che. This dharma bloodline must be astonishing...'

Li Ximing gave a polite smile and then said,

"This 'Flying Monarch,' I have not heard the title before."

Lu An, who had been listening from the side, finally interjected with a laugh.

"It refers to a Golden Core cultivator from Outside the Profound! By today's standards, that would be a True Monarch... The old conventions have collapsed, after all, and such fine distinctions are no longer made. Anyone can be called a True Monarch. It's just that in ancient times, great importance was placed on one's Daoist tradition, and True Monarchs were typically from the Comprehending Profundity Dao..."

"As for cultivators from Outside the Profound, many were called Flying Monarchs, Wandering Monarchs, or Meritorious Monarchs. The 'Fei' in Flying Monarch (Fēijūn), meaning 'to fly,' indicates one without foundation or proof, without Profundity or Dao."

His tone was placid, and Zunxian, standing beside him, showed no change in expression. It was unclear whether this was not considered an insult, or if he was simply used to it. Li Ximing nodded silently before turning to say,

"This is Daoist Master Changyun... He is also a rogue cultivator."

Changyun was not one for formalities and simply gave a casual nod. The four of them then proceeded inward. As he stepped onto the bright, clear stone tiles and entered the small town of Chun, Li Ximing was finally struck with astonishment.

The bluestone underfoot seemed plain but was in fact Precious Sarcophagus Spring Stone. The gurgling river flowed with waters of the Clear Marsh. The buildings, of varying heights, were adorned with carved beams and painted rafters, the reds filled in with Radiant Fire and the blues painted with Converging Water. Profound mysteries permeated the air, where wondrous flowers and magical herbs grew, their leaves scattered by Horn Wood and their soil enriched by Valley Water.

Even the guests coming and going, the idlers chatting under the willow trees, were all individuals of considerable cultivation. The servants waiting under the eaves and the young attendants carrying tea and inkstones were cultivators who had already achieved a foundation of righteous energy.

The brightly shining spiritual light almost congealed into a solid mass within his spiritual sense. A single piece of bluestone from this place would be a treasure worthy of any lesser cultivator's attention. Li Ximing was rendered speechless. After a long moment, he finally looked up, exhaled, and praised,

"Truly worthy of Gu Prefecture!"

Everything before him was not only the epitome of luxury but also a vivid testament to the nobility of the direct lineages. Even with the Li clan's current prosperity, they were a long way from being able to construct an entire town out of treasures...

Hearing his words, Lu An simply shook his head.

"Merely useless things!"

These few words were as plain as water, yet they prompted all the divine ability masters present to nod in unison.

Merely useless things.

In the outside world, lesser cultivators fought to the death for resources that were, in truth, nothing more than useless trinkets to those of the Purple Mansion Realm. Here, they were casually used as paving stones. As for those cultivators outside... to be brutally murdered for an item to refine a Spiritual Artifact, or to have one's path to the Dao severed over a bit of water or qi, was truly not worth mentioning.

Li Ximing, however, had once been groomed as a Family Head and had witnessed firsthand the great waves of conflict and bloodshed these "useless things" could stir up. He felt a wave of emotion in his heart.

'For generations, my Li clan has governed the lake prefecture, balancing the various powers, establishing numerous immortal peak administrations, and nurturing both cultivators and common folk. Yet in the eyes of these Purple Mansion masters, all of this is merely taking useless things and distributing them to useless people... There is, of course, a much simpler method.'

'That is to gather it all to adorn one's own palaces, giving it to no one.'

In the space of a few words, they had already crossed the bluestone road and were gradually approaching the heart of the small town. Suddenly, they saw a pavilion, nestled among a cluster of grander structures. Built of bluestone and redwood, it was unassuming in appearance. Only upon drawing near did they see the three large characters above its entrance.

【United Eaves Pavilion】.

Lu An performed a solemn bow, then turned and explained,

"This is the 【United Eaves Pavilion】, originally left by True Monarch Daochun. The name comes from the idea of the Three Profundities gathered under a single eave. He invited the numerous Daoist traditions of Gu Prefecture, and several True Monarchs personally created paintings to illuminate the ancestors of their respective traditions!"

He continued with a serious expression, "There were not many to begin with, mostly from the Azure Profundity and Comprehending Profundity traditions. But the story became well-known, and every Daoist tradition began sending a disciple here, either to present a work of calligraphy or to submit a pictorial record to be housed within..."

"Ever since, divine ability masters have come from far and wide to trace their heritage according to these images. When there are omissions, later generations of disciples also contribute paintings. It has become a rule that any disciple of the Three Profundities who enters the prefecture must come to this pavilion to pay their respects. The visions within are different for everyone; each person's experience is unique!"

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat as he mused, 'Tracing one's roots? My family has no real Dao heritage, nor do we follow a specific Dao-path. All we rely on... is our bloodline...'

In terms of bloodline, the Moongaze Li clan had descended from the Bright Yang Li to the Jiangbei Li, and had now found its way to Jiangnan. Although there had been involvement from powers Outside the Profound, the Jiangbei Li were a prominent name during the Great Ning dynasty, thoroughly associated with the Encompassing Profundity tradition...

'But as for which heavenly faction we truly belong to... that's hard to say...'

He felt a pang of uncertainty, yet having been a Purple Mansion cultivator for many years, he could discern their purpose in bringing him here.

'This is clearly an olive branch from Longkang Yao to both sides. He wants to reframe this Dao-contention as an internal dispute within the Three Profundities, elevating it to a major affair concerning the distinctions between Daoist traditions. When the war went poorly, it was the Encompassing Profundity bloodline that gained a slight advantage. Now, at the peace talks, it is about the Three Profundities turning weapons of war into gifts of peace...'

For one, he could hardly refuse outright with so many watching. For another, Li Ximing himself was intensely curious about what he might see inside the pavilion.

'Will it be Bright Yang? And if it is... what kind of scene will I witness?'

His momentary hesitation was misinterpreted by Lu An, who smiled and said,

"Rest assured, Zhaojing, no harm will come to you. If you truly manage to see a trace or two of the Bright Yang lineage, it will only bring you benefits, not the slightest harm!"

He was afraid Li Ximing might misunderstand, but he was also worried he might get his hopes up only to be disappointed. After all, Li Ximing was not Li Zhouwei. If he were to walk in and see nothing at all, Lu An would not be surprised. He simply added with a smile,

"This Profound Pavilion isn't always accurate... After all, modern lineages are far less strict than those of ancient times. Disciples from Dao-precincts who haven't properly worshiped their ancestors or offered incense may find their connection slowly fading through the generations. But as long as you see something... there will definitely be a benefit."

"Even seeing a single portrait or a few words of calligraphy can be a great opportunity to nurture your own divine abilities, no less valuable than any common pill or spiritual item..."

Li Ximing felt a flicker of interest. He considered it for a breath, having some confidence in the concealing power of his Talisman Seed.

'If even Dharma Treasures cannot detect the anomaly, I shouldn't falter before a mere ancient formation! If I show weakness now, it will not only displease Longkang Yao but might also attract unwanted criticism...'

So, he followed with a bow of his own, took a step forward, and placed a hand on the pavilion door. He saw a golden light emerge from the seams of the door panels, pressing against his palm with a slight resistance.

"Creeak..."

It was, after all, a creation left by a True Monarch. Even with his divine abilities, pushing the door required some effort. With a soft sound, a sliver of golden light spilled out from the crack.

Heavenly Light!

More than half of the weight in Li Ximing's heart lifted at once. He channeled his divine abilities, pushed the great door open, and slowly stepped inside.

"BOOM!"

The sound of the door slamming shut echoed behind him. In an instant, the pavilion was plunged into pitch darkness. To his spiritual sense, the space felt impossibly deep, as if everything was situated in a distant place where he could not see his own hand in front of his face.

After a long while, a single, faint ray of light began to shine.

The space was not large, but in its center stood a Profound Platform. A golden radiance bloomed from it, moving like a slowly slithering Flood Dragon, baring its fangs and claws to illuminate the darkness, bit by bit.

To his right, a hint of color emerged, revealing a painting hanging in the hall. It was on a silk-like material, the ink ancient, depicting a figure that shone brightly in the golden light.

This figure stood clad in white robes, its face devoid of features. Faint gold flowed around it, and its long hair was bound by a single pin. The robes themselves had the texture of gold, and behind its head circled two halos—one as restless as fire, the other as brilliant as gold, utterly distinct from each other.

A wave of unfamiliarity washed over Li Ximing, and he found he could not look away. Then, characters began to light up beside the scroll:

‘【The Zhaoyuan Immortal of Solemn Brilliance of the Bright Yang】’

But as the light grew brighter, another painting to his left also began to glow. This one was on paper, its colors vibrant and its luster rich.

The figure in this painting was immaculately dressed, also with a blank face. A vertical mark on its brow resembled a jade scepter, and its sleeves hung with shades of azure and yellow. Wisps of clouds and smoke drifted around its body, and a leather belt was fastened at its waist as it stood in profile.

This painting, however, exuded a profound sense of familiarity. The aura of Bright Yang rushed toward him, and for no reason at all, Li Ximing felt he recognized it. An image of the Huai River Map flashed before his eyes.

Golden characters flowed like light:

【The High Radiance Minister of Profound Brilliance of the Bright Yang】.

Li Ximing's heart pounded in his chest.

Who else could this be?

'It must be... High Radiance True Monarch, Cui Yan!'

The one who, with a single stroke of his brush, had transformed the 【Huai River Map】 from a mere painting into a Spiritual Treasure!

Even as just a painting, the familiar aura was overwhelming—it was the Huai River Map, Radiant Origin Pass, High Radiance Concealing Light, and the Star-Governing Treasure Disc... Nearly all of Li Ximing's divine abilities were triggered at once, an indescribable sensation.

'Bright Yang Minister...'

His face flushed slightly. Unconsciously, the entire pavilion had brightened, filled with a thousand flowing streams of light that seemed to transform the space into a boundless heaven and earth!

Flanked by the other two, the painting in the very center finally illuminated fully, growing ever more radiant until it seemed cast from profound gold, drawing all the scattered light back into itself.

This painting also depicted a single figure.

This person's face was blank. He wore a profound robe and golden armor, seated on a precious carriage drawn by a white luan. There was nothing particularly unusual about him, save for the six overlapping halos behind him, each blooming with its own magnificent light, revealing a myriad of mesmerizing colors even within the painting.

As a sovereign, he received the homage of kings, crowned and enthroned. As union, birds rose and fell, yin and yang intertwined. As heavenly light, his brilliance spanned ten thousand leagues, profound mysteries roaming free. As Bright Yang, he ruled over all creation from within the three suns!

He stared, stunned, as if a million thoughts were tearing through his mind, exploding with such force that his soul nearly left his body. His train of thought shattered, his mouth was dry and tasteless, and he no longer knew where he was or who he was looking at...

An instant passed—or perhaps it was several years—before a line of golden characters was finally reflected in his pupils.

【The Bright Yang's Emperor of Brilliant Splendor, the Heavenly God Who Governs the Ages】.

Bright Yang Emperor!

These words seemed to thunder down from antiquity, jolting him to his senses. A fine layer of cold sweat broke out across his skin. He could finally read the words again, could feel his own lips, yet his entire soul still felt shrouded in that terrifying, colorful light.

'Emperor of Bright Yang...'

The first Bright Yang, Lord of Wei Huang Heaven, the Imperial Monarch who ended the age of chaos and founded the Celestial Dynasty, who deposed the northern Immortal Daos, the sole and absolute Lord of Bright Yang, the supreme ruler of the mortal world...

'Emperor Wei, Li Qianyuan.'
