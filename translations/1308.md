# Chapter 1308: My Vision, My Design (Part 2)

In the sky, vaporous clouds lingered. The old man let out a soft sigh. Amidst the heavy banks of mist, the hue of a divine ability meandered forth, flowing across the horizon.

A dim light descended from the sky. A sharp, thin voice faintly pierced the air nearby. Then, someone was seen stepping out. His appearance was ugly, and he had a pair of horns. His expression, however, was somewhat complex. He performed a bow and sighed,

"Daoist Master Xiao, we meet again!"

This person was precisely Wang Long!

He glanced around, fell silent for a moment, and said gratefully,

"Many thanks, Daoist Master, for giving Wang Long an errand to run today."

Xiao Chuting quietly stared at him.

For some reason, this Underworld emissary dared not say more, but only stepped back slowly, saying,

"Please..."

Xiao Chuting was perhaps waiting, or perhaps he was just regulating his breathing.

He sat there for a long time, but there was not the slightest disturbance in the sky.

Pit Water was utterly silent.

Xiao Chuting slowly opened his eyes.

His eyes were still calm.

He seemed to understand the attitudes of the various great powers, to see clearly the condescending, pitying, and sympathetic gazes of those great figures from back then, and to know what purpose his breakthrough had ultimately served.

At this moment, Xiao Chuting even understood why he had been able to step into Moongaze Lake.

'This was a test directed at Moongaze Lake, and it was also my reassurance.'

It was to ensure that he, Xiao Chuting, upon facing the silent heavens and earth and understanding the Cangzhou deception...

...would still be willing to try!

As long as he still believed there was a chance, he would try!

But now, sitting in the sky, he only found it laughable.

'They have far underestimated my determination for Dao-accomplishment.'

Dense, dark clouds once again enveloped the world.

These clouds were different from the previous ones that blotted out the sky, but rather resembled the roiling vapor of mountain forests, dim and lightless. It seemed as if countless ghosts stirred within, and one could almost hear sounds of bitter weeping, the anguish of a hero forced to kneel.

The old man pressed his palms together before his chest.

Darkening Clouds.

'Haa...'

The dark clouds made the expressions of the various divine abilities on the horizon shift, and the atmosphere grew faintly strange.

True Fire fell silent, golden qi trembled, and Mansion Water flowed darkly, each harboring its own secrets, quiet and wordless.

But the old man could no longer stop the transformation of his divine ability.

Inch by inch, clouds peeled from his body and merged into the world.

A winding river then emerged from the horizon, its bright waters reflecting the vestiges of countless mountains and streams, undulating between narrow peaks, meandering and turning.

Grieving River Departure

This water shimmered with an ethereal blue light, appearing and disappearing, rising and falling erratically, transforming into the waters of a hundred rivers that roamed across the land.

In an instant, it had created an entire landscape of mountains and streams, a dazzling sight.

Entering the Pit's Abyss

This divine ability, known as Holding the Ridge, flowed forth.

In an instant, the landscape transformed; high mountains surged upward and deep chasms sank into the earth, stacking one peril upon another.

It was an abyss of unknowable depth, dark shadows cowering far below.

The old man sat high atop the mountain peak, and then a jade-green light quietly descended.

Man on Creek

Xiao Chuting's eyes snapped open, his white hair finally fanning out.

His hands grasped at the air, and the phantom of a long, white-jade rod appeared.
Profound light from heaven and earth plunged straight into the abyss, drawing out countless demons and evil spirits, their auras surging.

The four great divine abilities merged into one.

The old man seemed to become the very source of Pit Water, seated between heaven and earth.

A gale whipped his white hair, and his eyes were utterly cold.

The white-jade rod bent to its limit, as if hooked into the infinite depths of the abyss.

_Twang!_

In that instant, an extremely dangerous premonition struck everyone's minds.

The white-jade rod snapped straight.

Countless peaks collapsed, and the waters of the abyss surged forth, bringing with them the endless... demons from the depths of Pit Water!

These figures blotted out the sky.

Some were human, some demon, baring fangs and brandishing claws, as massive as mountains.

Some drooled rank saliva from bloody, abyssal maws.

Some destroyed bridges and capsized boats, stealing wealth.

Some resided ten thousand metres high, cold and indifferent as ice.

One by one, they spat poisonous mists, drank human blood, and unleashed thousands of vengeful souls.

Amidst the overflowing Pit Water, the demons completely surrounded the old man!

At this moment, Xiao Chuting had already stood up, his last simple robe fluttering in the gale, his eyes a mask of perfect calm.

Position Follows Peril.

This fifth divine ability lit up, and an incomparably vast phenomenon finally erupted from Xiao Chuting.

Position Follows Peril!

Five hundred years of cultivation walking a knife's edge was perilous enough.

Fighting in the Great Tomb River and Dwelling in the Pit-Stream was perilous enough.

Forcing a True Monarch to personally use a profound mystery to deceive him was perilous enough.

The entanglements of five, or even more, True Monarchs were also perilous enough.

Being caught between the three great peak powers of the world—this was peril beyond peril!

Xiao Chuting's talent was not high among those seeking the Dao, and his Dao-comprehension on the path of the Quest for Gold was mediocre.

But by being entangled in the world's conflicts, by single-mindedly scheming and suspecting, he had reached the very apex of peril!

This was the only thing he, Xiao Chuting, could actively pursue, and it was now his only support and his only advantage!

This terrifying conceptual-aspect rippled out, slamming into the surrounding demons in an attempt to suppress them all, but Xiao Chuting stopped, his hands clasped behind his back.

He raised his head, quietly gazing at the leaping shadows beside him.

In that instant, all the shadows coalesced.

The figures that should have been resisting his divine ability ceased to move, frozen by his gaze.

Xiao Chuting seemed to be staring at something.

All sorts of doubts began to surface in the onlookers' minds.

Several Great Daoist Masters exchanged glances, feeling a faint unease.

Li Zhouwei likewise frowned, his gaze fixed on the scene.

This King Wei knew clearly in his heart that Xiao Chuting's significance to him was not simple.

Both had offended the three great powers; both had only the lake to rely on.

The Xiao Chuting of today held great meaning for the Li Zhouwei of tomorrow!

The old man's intense gaze lasted only a moment.

A smile touched his lips as the gale blew back his white hair.

He began to look around, and as his gaze swept past, every demon began to roil and transform.

The one drooling rank saliva from an abyssal maw grew horns, mounted the clouds, and seethed with greed.

The one destroying bridges and stealing wealth sank to the depths, emanating thousands of ghostly lights, seizing all by force.

The one residing ten thousand metres high, cold as ice, ascended into the sky, ruling all, and drawing on profound qi.

The other beings changed one by one; some became two-faced, reflecting each other, sitting alone in the abyss; others bore metal and rode the wind, changing endlessly, flanked by two young attendants.

The remaining lesser demons were too numerous to count.

And in that instant, all these demons were nourished, growing boundlessly vast!

The old man's figure was shrouded in these endless shadows, the cold resolve in his eyes growing clearer, now tinged with a mocking smile.

'Use me, Xiao Chuting, as a pawn?'

As these three figures manifested with increasing clarity, their forms became boundlessly tall, reflecting in the watching eyes that were infused with divine abilities.

Shock and unease began to surface in those gazes.

'Such audacity!'

They were all Great Daoist Masters; how could they fail to see what those things in the sky were!

This Daoist Master Xiao—he had actually used his outstanding talent and Dao-comprehension to reflect Position Follows Peril, borrowing the power of the three great factions manipulating the situation, cutting off the momentum of Pit Water, and borrowing the phenomena of the three supreme Daoist Traditions of the mortal world!

And this perfectly matched the perilous nature of Pit Water!

A pointed insinuation!

In that instant, Dongfang Heyun raised his head for the first time, gazing at the distant old man enveloped in heavy shadows.

His eyes held no anger, no coldness, only a surging admiration.

'What skill!'

'This was no spur-of-the-moment decision; he was prepared long ago! When? In Jiangnan? He saw it all... From Jiangnan to the Great Tomb River, in just three short years... He endured his suffering, just waiting for this very moment!'

'What a brilliant way to borrow power! What a swift and vicious spit in the face!'

This was the final step of the Quest for Gold.

Even though he was borrowing power, even though he was being satirical, no one dared to interrupt Xiao Chuting.

If they did, would the loss of face not be even greater?

The smile on his face seemed ready to overflow.

'How ironic! How bitterly ironic!'

'We descendants of the Hornless Dragon are not afraid. We are not demons. Who, then, are the demons?'

His smiling gaze pierced the layers of mist, landing on the bottomless, dark clouds on the other side.

The black-robed emissary stood quietly in the air, his face serene, but his body was canted slightly forward, betraying a hint of agitation.

"The Mountain is formidable as ever, not even sending anyone. But you lot—you have to keep your eyes wide open and just take it!"

_Rumble!_

As if in response, thunder flashed.

The pitch-black shadows had already swelled to fill the world.

With every metre they rose, the light beneath Xiao Chuting's feet brightened, and the might pressing down on him grew heavier.

He remained standing in place, looking up at the sky.

The light of Position Follows Peril had been urged to its extreme, congealing in the sky as a boundless, ethereal blue.

A speck of brilliant gold was finally drawn by this supreme might, scattering down with the blue radiance.

Metallic Essence!

To Embrace Peril is the Nature of Pit Water's Abyss!

This strand of Metallic Essence seemed to answer from an infinitely distant depth.

It did not descend into the world, but rather bestowed its profound favor upon him, allowing Xiao Chuting to stand firm within the spreading darkness.

At this moment, Xiao Chuting felt a peculiar pull.

'If I just relax my spirit... just relax my spirit... reverse my cultivation and aim for this ownerless Metallic Essence, I can depart, reincarnate, and seek another chance.'

As the greatest beneficiary of the Chen Clan's legacy, Xiao Chuting naturally possessed the spell arts for reincarnation, as well as the Dao-Profundity to transcend...

But he did not spare it a single glance.

'I will refine my own Gold!'

The moment he severed all other thoughts, Xiao Chuting finally sensed the vast aura of the world—it was the great rivers and streams, the surging profound river, the bottomless abyss, the water in the pit, the passage of time, the desperate struggle.

It was the Pit.

'The Golden Position...'

Pit Water's attention focused on him—the moment to complete the Quest for Gold and attain the position was now!

But at this moment, Xiao Chuting also sensed the despairing, overflowing, and overly abundant authority within Pit Water, all of it concentrated into this position, faintly resisting his very being.

Even though he was clad in infinite peril.

The path of the Quest for Gold had reached its final step.

The Fruition Attainment was watching.

His five divine abilities could only converge within the heavy shadows, igniting tiny, colorful sparks, refining unceasingly, until a speck of gold emerged!

This speck of gold also transformed endlessly.

Although it lacked the vastness of the one it was faintly connected to, _this_ was the Metallic Essence that belonged to him, Xiao Chuting!

Only when this speck of gold appeared did the ownerless Pit Water Metallic Essence, hidden behind an endless veil, seem to be drawn.

The Great Void, like a tunnel, began to manifest at Xiao Chuting's side.

This was the final step of seeking the Dao.

He, Xiao Chuting, had the blessing of the ancient Pit Water and cultivated an ancient Daoist Tradition.

Whether he succeeded in his verification or not, this Metallic Essence would manifest and merge with him.

At that time, a peerless demon might very well be born!

But this was meaningless to Xiao Chuting.

This was merely the goal of the various Daoist Traditions: to use the nurturing virtue of that Mansion Water True Monarch from long ago to summon this Pit Water Metallic Essence.

The Dragon-kin would then be able to rest easy, and Mount Luoxia would be rid of this scourge.

As for its final owner, it would be either the Underworld or that Lord Xuan Cang!

In that instant, everything in his vision changed.

The sky was no longer an endless grey-white, but was gradually returning to a transparent clarity.

He finally saw it—the vast, hazy-grey figure that stood between heaven and earth.

It carried a Hornless Dragon on its back.

The Hornless Dragon rested its head on the figure's shoulder, hanging low.
Blood faintly visible between its teeth transformed into an endless waterfall that cascaded down the vast body for thousands of metres.

The dragon's body coiled around the figure's chest, circling down until it was swallowed by the mists behind.

Only then did the eyes in that dragon's head slowly open.

A pair of vertical pupils, as large as the blazing sun, cold and cruel.

The peerless peril that Xiao Chuting had condensed by exhausting his life's Dao-Profundity and borrowing a sliver of the conceptual-aspects of the three great Daoist Traditions seemed no larger than a single scale on that Hornless Dragon, like a lone seashell lost in a boundless ocean.

But the old man did not close his eyes, nor did he look away.

He held his head high, gazing unblinkingly at the figure.

A thousand tales of excess flashed in his eyes like distant stars.

If not for the protection of the Metallic Essence, he would have surely lost his mind.

As this terrifying sight flashed in his pupils, his divine abilities burned in the sky, refining that Metallic Essence: Darkening Clouds, Grieving River Departure, Entering the Pit's Abyss, Man on Creek, and even Position Follows Peril!

But no matter how fiercely the divine abilities burned, or how bright the Metallic Essence shone, even as the ascendant Position Follows Peril faded, the primary position still demanded more.

'Boundless Ocean...'

The Pit position in the sky did not draw closer in response to the Metallic Essence.

His aura, which had been approaching that supreme position, now faltered at its peak, sliding back bit by bit like a bird with a broken wing.

A powerful sense of suffocation and exhaustion assaulted his mind, accompanied by waves of dizziness.

Xiao Chuting understood: the True Monarchs in the sky were quietly waiting for his Metallic Essence to congeal after he perished.

In that instant, countless memories and images flickered before his eyes; at times, the towering figures that connected heaven and earth; at times, his elder brother kneeling at his feet; at times, a river so deep its bottom was unseen...

In this moment, on the boundary between life and death, he seemed to see all of the future.

He saw the endless, bottomless Underworld.

The boundless Yellow Springs flooded his vision, red flowers drifting on its banks, and from amidst those springs, a darkness slowly emerged.

It was still a sky full of falling snow.

The black-robed old man leaned back in his chair, another person standing beside him.

The old man wore a faint smile, his voice soft,

"Daoist Friend Xiao."

Yang Tianya—or rather, Judge Yang.

It was just like their conversation in the darkness of Jiangnan.

Everything in the Great Tomb River seemed a long dream.

Time itself seemed to flow backward.

The straw cape and hat were upon his shoulders again, and Xiao Chuting was standing in the snow once more.

"Have you considered my offer?"

This time, Xiao Chuting's face showed no struggle, no hesitation, only a faint smile.

"Lord Yang."

"I, Xiao, am unwilling to accept even a Surplus Position. How could I possibly consent to becoming a ghost or spirit?"

He burst into heaven-shaking laughter, causing the smile to fade from Judge Yang's face.

His haunting eyes stared at this Dao-seeker in the darkness for a long time before he finally spoke.

"Who was it."

The expression on his face froze.

He seemed to have an answer, yet he trembled with disbelief.

He stood up and stepped forward.

Darkness swallowed the man before him, leaving only his cold, icy words.

"Xiao Chuting."

"Who was it?"

Xiao Chuting's eyes suddenly lit up, and a calm smile played on the old man's lips.

"I've figured it out, Lord Yang."

He stared at the Underworld ghost-spirit before him, his voice filled with a gleeful, mocking delight.

"I asked you back then how much I had guessed correctly. You said sixty percent."

"I know where the other forty percent is."

"The great affair at the end of the Liang... Touba... the Dragon Monarch... Xuan Cang... Dongfang Tianye... Fenglin... It's not enough... I'm missing one."

"Hiding the Boundless Ocean within Pit Water... this is the 'hoarding' of water. She would never pass up such an achievement. She participated too... didn't she? The Boundless Ocean has remained hidden in Pit Water all this time; it couldn't have been done without Her help."

Yang Jinxin stared deeply at the old man, searching his eyes for any change, but found nothing.

The Underworld judge finally understood.

He said, "So that's how it is."

All the darkness vanished in an instant.

A spot of light appeared on the Underworld ghost's face, a pale, tender-green white shining forth, and Judge Yang's face was suddenly split apart.

A speck of pure, bright light crossed the horizon, extending all the way to Xiao Chuting.

It was a slender hand.

Its color was as radiant as the bright moon, its wrist whiter than frost or snow.
It pulled him from that endless, sunless place, back to the mortal world, back to this crumbling grotto-heaven, above the boundless Pit Water.

In that instant, heaven and earth trembled.

Whether it was the shadow towering at the horizon or the venerable figure clad in the Hornless Dragon, both were profoundly shaken in that instant, so much so that all the various divine mysteries and gazes from even further away converged entirely on this very moment.

The august voices of these venerable figures, carrying endless profound mystery, caused the Great Void to tremble and sent spiritual flux streaming everywhere. This phenomenon did not manifest in the mortal world; instead, it converged unceasingly in the distance:

Valley Water!

The Great Repository of Primordial Breath, the Profound Matriarch.

Xuan'nu!

Her appearance seemed to stem from this grotto-heaven's function of gathering all waters into the abyss, yet she was also but the tiniest droplet of water, a drift of rain and mist, a dark, bottomless ripple.

But when She appeared, Her very existence occupied the supreme realm of water's capacity to contain.

She still manifested as Valley Water, not revealing Her true form.

In the mere instant Her presence filled the world, all the gloomy, baneful qi and the overflowing excess of the Pit were grasped in that small, white palm.

It was as if they had been there all along.

A terrifying illusion filled the hearts of all the divine abilities: a hand, so small and soft, yet with a single gentle squeeze, it could shatter everything in this world and receive it into the bottomless repository of primordial breath.

This was the Profound Matriarch of Nine Heavens, Lady Xuan'nu, sole wielder of Valley Water, the only autonomous of the Five Waters, the great cultivator who had stood in the heartland of the Dragon-kin for a thousand years, undiminished!

The speck of Metallic Essence in the sky shone with brilliant light.

Xiao Chuting raised his head.

All the visions in the sky had vanished, leaving only an endless grey.

The Pit Water position, which had been receding from him, trembled in the distance.

The Profound Mystery locus, heavy for untold years, suddenly lightened, showing the great phenomenon of returning to its proper course.

His lips trembled as well, along with the very breath in his chest.

'My lady... I... I remember now.'

That shifting, heavy dimness, that soft, beautiful voice from the bottom of the abyss that had revealed mysteries to him... The layer of grey haze in the old man's eyes receded.

His eyes were clearer than ever, filled with a blinding, brilliant light.

'The Valley, which governs the hoarding of water.'

The water in the grotto-heaven strangely stopped rising.

In the mortal world, every stream and river began to tremble.

The mainland plunged into a darkness so profound one could not see one's hand.

The blazing sun was clearly still in the sky, and mortals were unaffected, yet a strange gloom shrouded the vision of every cultivator.

In the north, the surging great river suddenly changed course, breaking free of its channel.

A vast white expanse, like an avalanche, burst from the riverbed that had flooded and raged for centuries, forging a new path northward.

In the darkness, it crashed into the lands, roaring like a tsunami, and slammed against the formations of one prefecture city after another, dying the sky ink-black.

The court of Yan, the lands of Qi, the lands of Jin...

Across the entire north, great cultivators raised their heads one by one, gazing at the horizon in shock and terror.

'This... this is...'

'Who is achieving Dao-accomplishment! Or has someone perished!'

In the south, in the Jianghuai region, the virtue of water returned to its proper course.

The three rivers of Sanjiang crossed all obstructions, connecting at once to form a single, vast river flowing from west to east.

The dense river networks were once again nourished, revealing vast acres of fertile farmland before the shocked eyes of millions.

A spring breeze brushed the land.

The Huai River, vanished for nearly a thousand years, had returned to the world!

'It was Her... So it was Her, playing her piece so long ago... using Xiao Chuting, using the moment of the Pit position's manifestation...'

And the apex of all these phenomena converged in this grotto-heaven, landing upon the old man.

Dongfang Heyun raised his eyes, the reflections within them shifting, his face darkening.

'She... has temporarily hidden... the Boundless Ocean.'

The smile on this spirit cultivator's face gradually twisted.

'Yes... it's Her. The Boundless Ocean has penetrated too deeply into Pit Water. Mansion Water's so-called borrowing is nothing but empty talk... But if Valley Water takes action... the deeper it is, the more unseen, the easier it is for Her to hide it...'

'She is borrowing the change in Pit Water... but why...'

As a loyal servant of the Dragon-kin, Dongfang Heyun knew many secrets that ordinary cultivators did not.

His eyes flashed with profound understanding.

'Expending her cultivation... damaging her phenomenon... offending all the great powers... This is not something She would do... unless... unless She intends to use this as an achievement. Her final goal is not its return, but a deeper concealment.'

'The act of concealment that hides the Boundless Ocean, allowing the Orthodox Position to attain the Dao; the concealment found in perishing, embodied by the Lord of Pit Water's fall; and the inherent concealment that must exist due to the conflict between the Boundless Ocean and the primary position...'

The storm in the sky changed rapidly.

An intense karmic backlash erased all surveillance from the great divine abilities.

This loyal servant of the Dragon-kin seemed to tear off his mask, as if replaced by another person entirely.

The gloom vanished from his face, replaced by a cold, harsh expression.

"Xuan'nu."

Dense cracks spiderwebbed across his cheeks, as if something were about to burst from his body.

His voice carried a strange and extraordinary fury.

"You are attaining the Dao Embryo... You _dare_ to attain the Dao Embryo..."
