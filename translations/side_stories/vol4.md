# Extra Chapter

**Author’s Note**

This extra delves into themes of angst, tragedy, and deep self-reflection that can lead to some emotional twists, seen from a few different angles. If those aren’t your thing, you might want to skip this one.

The characters here take a little detour from their main story selves, so it’s best to read this as a separate piece without connecting it too much to the main plot or emotions.

## Winter Scenery

The lands of Eastern Yue were always sticky and damp, and the pattering rain struck the leaves with a clamorous sound, yet his own robes bore not a trace of rainwater, reflecting a faint halo.

Chen Donghe moved through the mountain forest for a while, followed his memory to find that cave, and then found that flat stone. He lowered his gaze, his expression subdued, and began to think carefully.

'Back then... the King sat here, Brother Qiuyang was on lookout... Uncle Yesheng was also here, they all heard it.'

'The King asked me if I wanted to marry Jingtian.'

He was now a great cultivator, renowned throughout the Li family's nineteen peaks and one hundred nineteen towns. He was an immortal cultivator on Mount Yuting overseeing the great arrays, traveling back and forth to the central island. He had experienced so much, had not died in the lands of Eastern Yue, had not paled before Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and had not retreated even before a brutal junior covered in scales, remaining ever loyal and calm.

Chen Donghe, however, sat down in the corner that had belonged to him back then, his clean robes settling on the dirt and weeds; he stared deeply into the pitch-black, deserted, dripping rainy night, thinking,

'I actually believed it.'

Chen Donghe vaguely remembered meeting Li Chejing. That year, Li Chejing had returned home to visit family, clad in a white-feathered robe, carrying the Qingsui immortal sword, and looking back now, he was still a figure of the first order.

He had been at the village entrance sharpening a salvaged arrowhead and was struck dumb by the sight. The young man had a gentle smile and a clear voice, his white robes fluttering, like an immortal descended from the heavens.

He asked,

"What is your relationship to Chen Erniu?"

"He is my father!"

Chen Donghe clasped his hands awkwardly and almost subconsciously led him inside. On the surface, his etiquette was proper, but inwardly, his heart was churning like a boiling sea, for he had never seen such a person and felt deeply envious.

This was the first time Chen Donghe had a real impression of the Li family. He returned silently along the riverbed, an indescribable feeling in his heart, and from then on, he became reserved and no longer dared to wear white.

As he grew older day by day, he was sent up the mountain by Chen Erniu. His father was old, and he said,

"You are the foremost person of our family now. You must regard Xiangping as your father, and in your conduct, the first person to learn from is Li Tongya. If you can learn eighty percent, it will be something to boast about."

Chen Donghe committed this to memory. He went up the mountain and entered the house, which was somewhat dim. A man sat quietly by a desk with his back to the light, half his face veiled in shadow, his wolf-pelt cloak imposing. Those sharp eyes swept over him with a light glance.

The young boy was thoroughly frightened.

Li Xuanfeng possessed these same eyes.

Later, when Chen Donghe learned Jingtian was to marry him, Li Xuanfeng lifted him up with one hand, and in his suspicion, those eyes held that same quality, yet they were different.

Li Xiangping's ruthlessness was the kind that extinguished any thought of opposition, even frightening one into an irresistible submission, and finding a sense of stable compliance in doing so. Li Xuanfeng, however, was like a blade, threatening to stab viciously into one's body, but he lacked that same aura that compelled obedience.

Chen Donghe had once thought that Li Xiangping ought to be a Monarch, sitting just like this in the high position, his face obscured in the shadows, while Li Xuanfeng was more like a great general under his command, one who would return from a thousand-li expedition having crushed the enemy army, majestically holding the commander's banner, his treasured sword still dripping blood, yet still having to prostrate himself before his father and report respectfully.

He could not resist, and soon he was serving him as he had served his own father. He organized things for him on normal days and occasionally caught sight of Li Tongya. By that time, Li Tongya had already started a family and was steady and magnanimous, though he didn't show any particular style that surpassed the ordinary.

Chen Donghe soon achieved a cultivation base and was dispatched to organize the troops. He went up the mountain, clad in armor, and saw a girl.

She sat by the window holding a raccoon cat, her beauty clean and sharp. She was pressing her lips together, a look that pressed right into his heart. Chen Donghe didn't realize it at first and completed his task with a calm and collected demeanor, thinking to himself,

"They are all people of remarkable character."

Only after leaving the house did he realize his legs were trembling, as if walking on cotton. Only when he closed his eyes did he find that image of her pursed lips still in his mind, bright and radiant. He walked all the way from the mountain down into the town, and only after his father had called his name five times in a row did he blankly think,

"I'm done for."

---

Chen Donghe returned home from Eastern Yue. His waist and abdomen had grown thicker, and his face was covered in the marks of war, showing a new fortitude and fierceness. Both his cultivation and his physical body were stronger, but his spirit was shattered.

Li Xiangping was dead; how could he die...

Chen Donghe's confusion and helplessness reached an extreme. When Li Yesheng heard the news, he poisoned himself right in front of him, his corpse lying silently before him.

He felt something was wrong, and Li Qiuyang felt it too. This cultivator from a concubine's line even said to him,

"I just feel... even if all of us dropped dead, the King wouldn't die, so how could this happen... how could this happen..."

But family affairs were urgent, and before this confusion could be resolved, he had to throw himself back into his duties. Li Tongya took over and placed Li Xuanxuan in the main seat.

Chen Donghe hurried to pay his respects. This new Family Head, who was close to his own age, sat in Li Xiangping's original position, displaying none of the previous occupant's ruthlessness or composure, his back bolt upright, sitting only on the very edge of the seat.

Once the crowd had dispersed, Chen Donghe would notice Li Xuanxuan hastily standing up from the seat to handle affairs from the side, leaving that high position empty, as if someone was still sitting there, silently supervising him.

Li Xuanxuan had also tried to emulate Li Xiangping, making a few secret attempts, but the same actions, when performed by him, came across as condescending, so he gave it up. Chen Donghe waited for a long time and finally heard good news—Li Xuanxuan wanted to marry his sister to him.

Chen Donghe felt a fire burn from his heart to his stomach, then shoot up from his stomach to his cheeks; his cheeks were astonishingly hot, but his forehead was ice-cold. Li Xuanxuan deliberately had him go and fetch her.

Hurrying over, Chen Donghe saw her writing something, her head tilted slightly as if in thought, the graceful line of her neck alluring. He hesitated a moment, then asked,

"I... you... ai! The Family Head asked me... if I would like... to be a pair... with you..."

Her eyes slowly widened, her lovely almond eyes staring straight at him, clearly taken aback, and a single word escaped her slightly parted lips,

"Ah?"

Chen Donghe watched her expression change, and the flame in his heart instantly died down. The look of yearning and wonder in his pupils was extinguished like a fire pit doused by rain, annihilated into a pile of cold, stirred ashes.

He sought her out afterward. She was always calm and gentle, neither distant nor close. Chen Donghe tried to curry favor for a long time, gradually feeling that he was her inferior.

No matter what he did, the woman before him was always perfectly calm, and occasionally even a little annoyed. Her eyes were terrifying when she was displeased, making him tremble.

'That damnable calm.'

He thought, utterly exasperated.

---

In the end, Li Jingtian still married him.

It was simple. He had a face that wasn't ugly, he was loyal and devoted, and he possessed a stable cultivation base that was more than sufficient. In all the towns, there wasn't a more outstanding man to be found.

Li Jingtian sought him out and asked him many things, just to make conversation; Chen Donghe was naturally overjoyed but faintly sensed her discomfort. He asked,

"Are you willing to marry me? If not, I will speak a word to the Family Head."

"Of course I am."

Li Jingtian gently pursed her lips, and the sight made his heart surge. Chen Donghe had very, very rarely acted selfishly, but now this intense impulse muddled his mind, and he pondered with self-deception,

'She is willing.'

So he blew out the candles in the bridal chamber and, just as he had wished, untied the garments of her dress. Beneath the wedding attire was the same white dress that he had found so bright and dazzling when they first met. This white dress finally fell into the darkness under the bed.

She lost all her usual calm and gentleness, cowering there, naked, her fair-white body like jade in the candlelight. Chen Donghe felt a great sense of compensation in his heart, and his lips trembled.

"Good... good... so you can be flustered too... good... so you can cower too. I thought you were invulnerable."

With that, his desire surged. When he kissed her, Li Jingtian would press her lips shut—excellent, perfect—but she didn't make a sound, like a dead person.

Chen Donghe's eyes quickly filled with tears. Li Jingtian's face was pale, but it was he who was crying. Chen Donghe only made it halfway before he stopped and began to wail.

Li Jingtian picked up her clothes to wipe his tears. Her own lips were trembling from the pain, but she still carefully dried his tears, hesitated a moment, and planted a kiss on his forehead.

The moonlight emerged, clear and bright. The woman before him had very white lips and very calm eyes.

Chen Donghe suddenly found he couldn't understand her. He sat there on the spot, while Li Jingtian sat beside him, hugging her knees until dawn. The girl draped her white dress back on, her almond eyes watching him quietly, her lips bloodless. She gathered up the bloodstained bedsheet and tiptoed out.

Many years later, when Chen Donghe recalled this night, he still felt he could die from the shame.

---

Everything seemed to return to normal. Li Jingtian did everything for him that a wife should, and he, in turn, found various ways to be good to her, to the point of doting. Their conversations were like those of allies advancing and retreating together.

Li Qingxiao was born, and everything got better. The girl was truly clever and sensible. Chen Donghe treasured her like a jewel, and Li Jingtian was even willing to exchange a few flirtatious words with him in front of their daughter.

When she was in a good mood, moved by his diligence, she would say with a smile,

"If I truly loved someone, I would want to die at thirty. I am a mortal and cannot preserve my beauty and dignity, and I would not want my beloved to see me in my remaining years, when my ugliness is exposed."

Sometimes she would also laugh,

"Why must you... with your cultivation and abilities, you are not lacking for women."

At such times, Chen Donghe would feel infinitely relaxed. But as soon as their daughter left the room, his wife's smile would slowly fade, and Chen Donghe would immediately feel oppressed once more.

Neither of them ever mentioned the sickness in their hearts.

Chen Donghe remained full of enthusiasm, and Li Jingtian wouldn't deliberately pour cold water on him. They lived in this seemingly sweet way for several years. Then, Xiao Xian married Qingxiao. Li Jingtian asked him about it, saying only that Xiao Xian wouldn't amount to much. Chen Donghe just said,

"It is enough to live an honest life. Why demand greatness! The hawk that soars to the heavens is shot down by the hunter in one or two tries, leaving my daughter all alone."

His wife said,

"That's not certain. Just because one doesn't soar, does that mean one will suffer no grievances?"

More than ten years passed, and Xiao Xian was killed in the demonic calamity. At that time, the two of them had gone to the great desert. Upon hearing the news, neither spoke, both falling silent, as if confronting the sickness in their hearts.

They remained this way until the messenger, not knowing what to do, finally left. Chen Donghe suddenly realized in the lamplight that she was no longer beautiful at all. Counting the years, his wife was already over fifty.

Li Jingtian seemed to sense the suppression in his eyes and turned her head away. He extinguished the lamp, lest his wife see his expression.

---

Another two years passed, and Li Jingtian's body began to fail. Chen Donghe, in turn, became even more attentive, even more meticulous. He insisted on doing everything himself, even to the point of neglecting his cultivation to nurse her body.

His wife would always watch him faintly, but Chen Donghe never met her gaze. He derived a great sense of relief from this, yet it also seemed like a shared punishment. Though Chen Donghe never spoke a word, his every action seemed to be a question.

"Here... look closely! How arrogant you were, how noble, but in the end, I am the only one here for you, cleaning up your filth, changing your clothes, washing you. I am the only one who cares..."

"How about it now? How about it now? You, a hideous, broken-down body! What right do you still have to criticize me!"

Li Jingtian's only request was for him to take her to the Western Mountains, to sit beside that stone seat shrouded in mist. Chen Donghe would watch her warily, terrified she might leap from it, but his worries were unnecessary.

Li Jingtian was still the same. Her face was no longer beautiful, but it still held a calm that made his lips tremble. He suddenly understood. Those sweet smiles, meant for a lover, Chen Donghe had never seen them on her face.

He would occasionally see Li Jingtian clench her fists, trying to sit up from the bed on her own. He would feel extreme pity and heartache, yet also a rising thread of security.

"You can't leave me."

That night, Chen Donghe again saw her fall from the bed. She remained icily silent, refusing to beg for help. He felt a rush of blood surge to his head, and he barely restrained himself, saying,

"Li Jingtian! What exactly is wrong with me? How have I wronged you?! This lifetime... this lifetime! Just open your mouth! You tell me! You tell me..."

His anger lasted only for a breath. Wiping away tears, he scrambled to lift her back onto the bed. Chen Donghe only asked,

"That thing you said when you were young... that was a joke, wasn't it."

Li Jingtian's lips were already white, but her eyes, as if burning away her life force, lit up with a trace of stubbornness. She only whispered,

"It was as true as iron."

---

As true as iron!

He gently laid her down and covered her with the quilt, speaking softly,

"Fine... fine... what was the point? It was my fault. You could have just not married me, instead of ending up like this."

Though he spoke these words, he carefully checked her condition, then lit the warming stove in the courtyard and rode the wind out in one breath. He had, after all, accepted the Family Head's order to gather qi at sunset.

But, in the end, he did not rush back as he usually did. Instead, he walked alone in the great desert for an entire night, returning covered in dew.

When he looked at the bed again, the old woman was already dead.

Chen Donghe was stunned. He saw her hands, dry and withered like chicken's claws, clutching tightly to the edge of the bed. He lay down beside her, just as he always did, and lay there with his eyes open until dawn.

Holding her, he went and sat at the Western Mountains again. The old man wept bitterly.

He actually understood.

Although she was a mortal, although she was as weak as tofu in his hands, she still maintained a near-cruel, cornered resistance against all that she did not love.

He leaned against the table, slowly dreaming his way back to that day many years ago. His hands were still fair and delicate. Li Jingtian, dressed in white, sat quietly by the window, gently pressing her lips together.

Chen Donghe was transfixed by the sight. Even today, he still felt he hadn't seen enough. He thought,

"If I could do it all over again, I could surely win her affection!"

Suddenly, a cold wind gusted in his face. The old man's eyes flew open. The rain in the Eastern Yue jungle dripped, drip-drip-drip. That stone lay coldly before him. Chen Donghe sat there blankly and looked down at his own hands.

A pair of old hands, covered in scars.

## Desert Scenery

In the vast desert, a lone plume of smoke drifted. She rode a senile Western Mountains mare, walking slowly through the glittering, golden world of sand and stone. Smoothing a few white strands of hair, she said,

"Chen Donghe, I've grown old."

The middle-aged man descended, riding the wind. His face was no longer young either, but he remained patient and gentle. Chen Donghe gathered her hair, looking at those scattered white strands, and said softly,

"I'll pluck them for you."

"No need, I'm afraid of the pain."

Li Jingtian gripped the reins, her face pale. Chen Donghe led the aging horse, and she sat there, lost in thought, as the yellow sands of the world blew around them, transforming them into two black dots, one large and one small, against the vast expanse.

---

As a child, Li Jingtian often had a dream. In it, she was outstandingly superior, walking through fire and water, commanding thunder and lightning, flying above the storm clouds with her hands behind her back. This dream had given her hope, until it was shattered at the age of six.

"No spiritual apertures in the body."

Only later did Li Jingtian understand that this was more fatal than any negation of her temperament or talent. If it couldn't be, it just couldn't be. She had no opportunity to prove herself. Thus, she rarely slept deeply again, afraid of returning to that unrealistic dream.

Of course, that dream never came again.

Later, Li Jingtian's father died, and her elder brother, Li Xuanxuan, took charge of the family's affairs. When Li Xuanxuan asked if she could marry Chen Donghe, Li Jingtian finally remembered such a person existed.

At that time, Li Jingtian had been gazing out the window one morning, wearing her favorite white dress, smiling brightly and clearly. She, of course, knew just how lovely she was.

She was no longer a little girl.

Every clever beauty, upon reaching the proper age, comes to understand her own power from the astonished gazes of others. Perhaps the first few times she relied on her beauty, she would fail, but after learning her lesson, she would grow stronger and stronger.

Perhaps those boys would sooner or later wake up, but in their teens, she was the dominator.

Li Jingtian was highly gifted in this Dao. She knew that as long as she remained as calm as water, her natural appearance and pretty almond eyes would go out and conquer her enemies for her, even if it was just a young man approaching respectfully.

"He fears my family's power, which is even better."

The young man's gaze darted about, full of greedy infatuation. It was Li Jingtian's first time wielding this power, yet it felt as if she had been born with it. It was effortless.

He wasn't ugly, and even had a certain dignified air. It was inevitable for a woman to feel a bit of vanity when loved by a boy with such unwavering eyes. Attracting attention is an instinct, but whether anything comes of it is another matter.

"Chen Donghe."

Li Jingtian's mood fluctuated for only an instant. He was a nobody, and she tossed him to the back of her mind.

---

The desert evenings were suitable for dreaming. The various types of spiritual qi in the sky glowed with multicolored light, and many cultivators shuttled through the air as she lay quietly in the warm sand.

"Chen Donghe."

Her father had passed away, and as expected, her big brother had become the Family Head. Li Jingtian felt he had become a stranger. Li Xuanxuan sat in that position and seemed to turn cold all at once, his former smiles vanishing, his eyes filled only with worry and ice.

He still called her 'sister' as usual, but Li Jingtian could hear that something was wrong.

"He no longer cares about anything... he doesn't even care about himself... so how could he possibly care about me, his sister."

In the haze, everything before her eyes gradually sharpened. Her second brother, Li Xuanfeng, his eyes fierce, lifted that young man clean up, the veins on his strong arm bulging, as if he would tear him to shreds in the next second.

Li Jingtian was unwilling to recall it and turned over. The dream blurred, then sharpened again. It was her younger brother, Li Xuanling.

Li Xuanling was holding a scroll, his face, which bore a strong resemblance to Li Tongya's, looking very steady. He was dressed in white, sitting quietly in the woods, reading the item in his hands once over, seemingly pondering it carefully.

Li Jingtian called out, but another person emerged from the woods behind him, only seven or eight years old, yet his expression was very mature. He gripped her hand tightly.

Li Jingtian looked down and saw the child say fiercely,

"If it really comes to that, I will kill you first, then kill myself!"

A tightness gripped Li Jingtian's chest. Both figures before her vanished, and only a cold, dead snake fell, landing on her chest, icy and sticky, startling her awake with a shock.

She quickly woke up, her throat stinging, feeling dizzy and thirsty. Chen Donghe was sitting quietly beside her, cross-legged in cultivation. Only then did Li Jingtian understand,

"This life of mine... is already just about over."

---

The desert wind howled. Li Jingtian always had Chen Donghe take her wandering, but she wasn't much in the mood to appreciate the sights, often dozing off on the camel's back.

She remembered taking that bloodstained sheet to see her mother, deliberately picking a time when she would run right into her big brother, Li Xuanxuan. The bloody corner of the sheet in her arms was revealed, as if in revenge.

Li Xuanxuan didn't dare look at her, freezing on the spot for a moment, as if he might jump. She, too, quickly gathered the sheet up guiltily and buried her head.

Sometimes Li Jingtian would feel dissatisfied with him, but in the end, she was powerless. She knew her brother Xuanxuan was far inferior to her brother Xuanling, and that she had to make up for his shortcomings in some areas.

But when she saw Li Xuanxuan in the main seat, sleepless day and night, anxious and uneasy, she couldn't muster any feelings against him. Later, even that little bit of vindictiveness vanished, and she only found him pitiful.

"Besides, with Yuanxiu around... it's still better that Big Brother is the one in charge. Just let little brother go and cultivate."

She had thought so at the time.

Back then, she had watched Yuanyun carefully. This child likewise had no spiritual apertures, and was likewise proud. Qinghong, at that time, was using a bamboo pole to knock down dates with him. The brother and sister sat under the tree, laughing, while Li Qinghong sat quietly beside them. It felt good.

Soon, Qinghong was riding the thunder, commanding lightning and electricity, becoming a pillar of the family. Yuanyun, meanwhile, trembled, not daring to make a single mistake under the watchful eyes of the clan elders, his smile gone.

Li Jingtian's chest had felt very tight, especially after hearing Li Qinghong's vow, which stunned everyone in the clan.

"This junior has no heart for romance, nor do I wish to be a wife or concubine... although I was born a daughter and not a son, I harbor the same aspiration to refine the six wheels and cultivate divine abilities, to pursue immortality, expel Demons, and protect the homeland and its people..."

She had mulled over those words twice later, feeling extremely uneasy.

---

As for Chen Donghe?

Li Jingtian dreamed for a long time before finding him at the edges of her vision, recalling his cold gaze and her white dress tossed on the floor. Li Jingtian felt irritated. She said coolly in her heart,

'What's the point?'

She never felt that she would, like in the stories, become deeply devoted just because someone had taken something from her. She knew she was stubborn and would never bargain over something that had already been taken.

She was smart and unwilling to submit to another. His one-sided actions were actually useless. She understood his intentions but had no interest in this game of conquest and submission.

Yet, the more she ignored him, the more she could feel his lust spiraling out of control, slowly becoming something she could manipulate at will.

Li Jingtian had tried to accept it, but the result was ice-cold. She could only say coolly to herself,

'I'm sorry... I just can't.'

But Chen Donghe was strong. He could crush her to pieces with a single movement. This inequality made her calmer and calmer, less and less able to accept it. A proud person walks further and further down their own path.

Moreover...

Moreover, she had no feelings for his bearing or his face. She only felt awkward. His imitated steadiness paled in comparison to her own elders. In reality, his head was a bit too large, which appeared clumsy in a woman's eyes.

Although his face was passable, it lacked that sort of courage. When calm, it was still tolerable, but when he became animated, he looked dreadful. This face was later passed on to Qingxiao. Both were passable when calm and composed, but not very good-looking when relaxed.

'Perhaps this person, this body, is desirable in the eyes of other women, but for me, I can only remain indifferent.'

She actually preferred men who were a bit more well-proportioned, a bit brighter.

'Who is at fault... it shouldn't be me.'

---

But she aged quickly, far more quickly than she had imagined. The beauty that was so easily obtainable in her youth was now like a cloud hanging in the sky, utterly unreachable.

Those beautiful almond eyes rapidly grew lax and her hair thinned. Her skin became wrinkled, revealing the bones beneath. Her complexion grew awful, appearing even more haggard in the desert wind.

Chen Donghe still looked the same, and his cultivation was even higher. The years had only made his features more mature. The status between the two seemed to have undergone a subtle reversal. Those things Li Jingtian had relied on as her shield had, unknown to her, fallen into someone else's hands.

But she didn't care. As she aged, she gradually lost her attachment to these things, but that bottleneck of disinterest remained, forever solidified in her heart.

The things Chen Donghe thought he was slowly building up his confidence with were, in fact, worthless in her eyes. Chen Donghe didn't say it, and neither did she.

She watched with cold eyes as the two of them tormented each other. She found Chen Donghe's self-tormenting actions to be childish. Not only that, she was even growing tired of it. The word 'childish' was suppressed in her throat as she watched him coolly.

---

That night, she kept dreaming of the dead snake rolling over her neck, icy and sticky. Chen Donghe's face appeared before her. The man finally lost control, asking again and again, demanding an answer.

Li Jingtian did not clarify. She knew it would leave a deep shadow on the man, whether light or heavy, and it was now beyond remedy. But Chen Donghe asked,

"That thing you said when you were young... that was a joke, wasn't it."

She suddenly experienced a hallucination of walking through fire and water, commanding thunder and lightning, and flying above the storm clouds with her hands behind her back. She wanted to laugh, but she was already losing consciousness.

She knew what the man before her was saying. If Li Jingtian truly had feelings for him, she would never have used the rest of her life to torment him and herself. But on this matter, she absolutely could not back down. Li Jingtian said coolly,

"It was as true as iron."

As true as iron!

She vaguely saw the man's face before her seem to shatter, his eyes growing down below his mouth as crystalline tears fell. She quickly sank into her own dream.

In the heavy darkness, she vaguely dreamed of a field of white. She was still dressed in her white robes, leaning quietly against the window, holding a white raccoon cat in her arms.

Footsteps approached the door, but the young man outside had not yet entered. Li Jingtian slowly rose and said warmly,

"Father, I will take my leave first."
