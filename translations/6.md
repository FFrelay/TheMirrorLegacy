# Chapter 6: The Jade Stone

Li Tongya and Li Xiangping entered the reed marsh, parting the dense layers of reeds to look, and saw the blue-grey mirror glowing warmly with white light; Li Xiangping glanced in the indicated direction and whispered:

"That's the direction of Moongaze Lake; if we follow the Guli Dao, it should take about an hour."

Li Tongya shook his head and said, "We can't take the Guli Dao; we'll cut through the reed marsh."

Li Xiangping quietly agreed and began to move forward with his brother, crouching low as they went.

Lu Jiangxian felt the pull growing steadily stronger, and upon entering the reed marsh, his vision brightened. A blurry scene appeared before him: what looked like a clear, cool lake, with a dozen white gulls and herons resting on one leg along the shore.

As Li Xiangping advanced, the blue-grey mirror in his hand grew hotter and hotter, making him deeply uneasy. He looked up at his second brother; Li Tongya's face was stern and he said nothing, but his eyes were filled with worry.

'Is immortal destiny truly something a mortal can touch...?' Li Xiangping mused, rubbing the mirror, oblivious to its scalding heat.

"Good mirror, precious mirror, we're almost there," he muttered, clutching the blue-grey treasure.

Before long, the two emerged from the dense reeds, and the shimmering expanse of Moongaze Lake, along with a flock of startled gulls and herons, leaped into view.

Lu Jiangxian stared directly at a rocky sandbar in the middle of the lake. There, among the moss-covered boulders, a piece of white-glowing jade was wedged tightly in a crevice.

The scalding blue-grey mirror suddenly erupted with a pale white lunar brilliance. Before Li Tongya and Li Xiangping's eyes, a blurry image of the sandbar appeared, showing the white-glowing jade in the stone crevice.

Li Xiangping and Li Tongya met each other's gaze, seeing the astonishment and joy in the other's eyes; Li Xiangping nodded emphatically, stripped off his clothes, and was about to wade into the lake.

"Wait!" Li Tongya stopped him, shaking his head.

"I'll get it. You wait on the shore with the mirror. If the moon moves to that position and I'm still not back..."

He pointed to a spot in the sky.

"You hide the mirror in the reeds and run for the Guli Dao. Don't go home," Li Tongya said, looking gravely at his brother. "Wait until the sun is high in the sky before you come back to check on things."

"Yes..." Li Xiangping's voice cracked, and he wiped away tears as he looked at his second brother.

Li Tongya gave a wry smile and stripped off his clothes, revealing strong arms, then turned and swam toward the lake, leaving Li Xiangping hiding in the reeds, staring blankly after his brother.

He had been to Moongaze Lake with his father and brothers in previous years and had swum back and forth countless times; he reached the center of the lake with practiced ease.

He carefully probed the many stone crevices, and within the time it takes an incense stick to burn, he had scoured the entire sandbar.

'Nothing.' Li Tongya frowned, checked again meticulously, and pulled out five or six small river crabs.

Just then, he felt a faint, cool sensation at his fingertips as he brushed against something smooth; applying pressure with two fingers, he pulled out a jade stone about two fingers wide.

The jade stone was shaped like a long tablet, its surface carved with some sort of script. Li Tongya held it up to the moonlight to decipher it:

'Supreme... Moon... Qi... Nurture Wheel...' He could only roughly make out a few characters. Li Tongya had learned to read from a tutor as a child and could recognize most words, but the patterns on this jade stone were intricate, and the script was ancient and unusual, making it extremely difficult to identify.

He glanced calmly toward the shore, gripped the jade stone tightly in his hand, and began swimming back.

"Third Brother!"

He climbed ashore and called softly toward the reeds, and Li Xiangping emerged. Li Tongya was just about to show him the jade stone when, as soon as he opened his hand, the jade "soughed" and transformed into a beam of white light, shooting into the mirror.

The sudden change made both of them tremble. They watched as white light surged across the mirror's surface, and even the moonlight itself seemed to dissolve into halos that poured into the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian, however, felt as if he had been struck by lightning. A white light slammed straight into him, and a boundless ocean of knowledge flooded into his mind. He cried out in pain and promptly passed out.

Li Tongya and Li Xiangping watched as the mirror in their hands, having swallowed the jade stone, slowly grew calm, the white light gradually dimming.

The golden-red morning glow climbed into the sky, falling on Li Tongya's bare upper body and tracing it in glittering lines. He looked down at his brother and said:

"Let's go home first."

————

Li Mutian sat at the red-lacquered wooden table, listening as his two sons clearly explained the course of events. He nodded and said to Li Tongya,

"Well done."

He and Li Changhu had tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep. Now, seeing his two sons return safely, his suspended heart finally settled.

"This house of ours, with its front and back yards, isn't small, and the backyard rests against the mountain. I'm thinking we dig up those two melon patches out front and build two more structures, connecting them left and right to form a large courtyard. Once the front gate is closed, we won't have to worry about prying eyes."

Li Mutian spoke slowly; he had this idea years ago. His children were growing up day by day, and it would soon be time to divide the family estate.

Thanks to his savings, the Li family was considered a prominent household in the village. After returning from the army, Li Mutian had bought over ten mu of paddy fields, and adding the five-plus mu of good land inherited from his father, they had nearly twenty mu in total.

Lijing Village's land and water were nourishing, and its reed marshes and mudflats were treasures that sustained life.

If one didn't count the labor, twenty mu of land in a bountiful year was enough to feed more than ten people; the Li family had long reached the status where they could close their gates and live as landlords.

It was precisely because the Li family had grain and land that his four children were able to learn to read and write. However, Li Mutian had never approved of idle, wealthy households, which was why he required his children to study and farm every day, so that they could all live well after the family property was divided.

"Now, this family cannot be divided. And the wives we find must also be trusted, one of our own."

Li Mutian recalled the great families he had seen in the city: a large compound housing the main family line, some studying for official posts, others training in martial arts to become generals—what a grand sight! In contrast, poor peasant families divided their property completely, severing all ties.

"We'll do it just like that!"

Li Mutian's eyes lit up, and he called out to his two sons.

"Go to the fields and call your eldest brother back to level the foundations; the fields can be left to the tenants to manage. Your fourth brother doesn't need to pick mulberries this afternoon, either. From now on, he will study at the tutor's place for the entire day."

"Right!" Despite being up all night, Li Xiangping was still full of energy; upon hearing this, he dashed out the door.

Li Tongya looked at his father, pondered for a moment, and then finally spoke:

"Father, are you planning to follow the clan laws from the books? Establish an ancestral hall, open a clan estate, study for officialdom, and train in martial arts for military command?"

"My Li family has been building its foundation for two hundred years; it is time."

Li Mutian smiled and waved his hand dismissively.

"As for studying and training, the Guli Dao is incredibly perilous. Entering and leaving Mount Dali, nine out of ten die. Our studies and training can't be sold to the Emperor of Yue State; it's merely a way to pass on the family legacy and protect ourselves, that's all."

Li Tongya nodded and said softly:

"Perhaps... there is something even more wondrous than studying and training."

"Don't speak such nonsense here."

Li Mutian laughed heartily, clapped Li Tongya on the shoulder, and walked out with his head high and his hands behind his back.
