# Chapter 3: The Mirror

"Ah, Brother Xiangping."

Li Xiangping was walking back with the basket on his back when a girl approached from a distance. The girl had a round face and very ordinary features, but her wide smile added a great deal of charm to her eyes.

"Sister Yun."

Li Xiangping smiled at the girl, then turned and offered her the basket of fish.

"Look at the fine fish I caught; you must take a few back to try."

"Oh, I couldn't possibly."

Tian Yun smiled and lowered her head; she had developed early and, at eleven, was already taller than the thirteen-year-old Li Xiangping.

In Lijing Village, people married between thirteen and fifteen. Among their peers, their ages were the most suitable, and the girl had long since considered the boy before her to be her future husband.

"Nonsense, take them!" He insisted, pressing two fish into Tian Yun's hands. Li Xiangping hadn't thought much of it; Uncle Tian was the kindest man in the village, and Li Xiangping liked him best, so it was only natural to look after his daughter.

After bidding Tian Yun farewell, Li Xiangping hurried home and dropped the basket into the small pond. He paused, then took out the mirror, wiped it clean, and tucked it into his robes before grabbing three wooden boxes from the table and heading for the fields.

There, his two older brothers were working the farm with his father.

The Li family had four brothers: Li Changhu, Li Tongya, Li Xiangping, and Li Chejing. In Lijing Village, everyone gave a thumbs-up when speaking of the four Li brothers.

Tian Yun's father often remarked with envy, "Li Mutian is truly blessed!"

The 'blessed' Li Mutian, however, did not see it that way. As the only person in Lijing Village who had ever traveled far, it pained him immensely to watch his children toiling in the fields.

"A proper man should study or lead soldiers; only cowards work the fields!" he would curse, jabbing a finger at Uncle Tian.

But such is life; those who have seen radiance often suffer the most for it. Li Mutian had served in the army, had killed men, and had returned to Lijing Village in his forties, using his military pay to buy land and become a wealthy household; yet, he was the most discontented of all.

When Li Xiangping reached the edge of the field, his eldest brother, Li Changhu, was already waiting in the shade of a tree. He was the oldest, and at seventeen, already had a mustache.

"Third Brother, slow down, there's no hurry."

Li Changhu smiled, rubbing Li Xiangping's head as he watched him gently.

"I heard from Uncle Tian that you had a big catch today."

"More than enough, Big Brother!" Li Xiangping laughed heartily. "We're finally eating well tonight!"

"You, really."

Li Changhu wiped the sweat from his brow, picked up a wooden box, and called out toward the field.

"Second Brother—"

"Coming!" Second Brother Li Tongya strode over, hoe in hand. He first sat and greeted Li Changhu as 'Eldest Brother' before turning to Li Xiangping with a smile.

"You two eat; I'm heading back." Li Xiangping had been busy all morning and was faint with hunger, so he hurried home.

While in Li Xiangping's basket, Lu Jiangxian had felt a faint, inexplicable pull. As they drew closer to the Li family home, this sensation grew stronger.

When they passed the large pagoda tree at the village entrance and entered the settlement, the attraction reached its peak. Lu Jiangxian felt his chest tighten, and the mirror's body began to tremble faintly within the basket, emitting a soft red glow.

'That is a part of me, or perhaps something of vital importance to me.' A realization dawned in Lu Jiangxian's mind.

'It's to the north! In the direction of that large lake!' As Li Xiangping moved away from the village entrance, the pulling sensation slowly faded, but Lu Jiangxian silently committed the direction to memory.

Tucked away with Li Xiangping, he was carried on a rough tour of the village. By combining his perception of mental activity with observations of actions and tones, Lu Jiangxian could basically understand what everyone was saying.

He discovered this seemed to be just an ordinary small village; there were no martial arts masters leaping over eaves and walking on walls, nor were there any cultivators flying about.

The people dutifully worked at sunrise and rested at sunset; the tools they used and the scale of their fields were entirely unremarkable.

'This place really does seem to be an ordinary village; the best house is merely a two-story, earth-and-wood structure...' Lu Jiangxian mused. 'If there were cultivators here, surely they wouldn't be living in a small mud hut?'

'Great power brings great productivity. This village is far too primitive.'

He now had a basic understanding of his situation, and a framework for his future plans began to take shape.

The Li household was especially busy that night, with the mother and the two youngest brothers busy washing vegetables and cooking.

Li Xiangping had returned with a full load, and his younger brother, Li Chejing, had secretly caught a nest of fat field mice while picking mulberry leaves for the silkworms on the back mountain, bringing them home smothered in a grain sack. Their delighted father, Li Mutian, clapped both boys firmly on the shoulders, praising them until they were bursting with pride.

At fourteen and fifteen, boys were growing fast, so the several dishes on the table were mostly finished by the brothers.

Li Mutian only took a single bite, and their mother, Liu Linyun, simply watched the four brothers with a beaming smile. Only the big yellow dog under the table paced anxiously, weaving between the six pairs of legs.

After dinner was finished.

The moon slowly climbed over Mount Dali. Li Xiangping leaned against the wall, chewing on a long blade of grass, while his father, Li Mutian, frowned at the sky as if searching for something.

"Oh, right, Father." Li Xiangping patted his father's leg and pulled the mirror from his robes.

"I found this thing in the river this morning."

"Oh?" Li Mutian took the mirror, narrowing his eyes as he turned it over and over.

"It's not iron, nor copper. What kind of treasure is this?"

The clear, cold moonlight seemed to drift down before the house, as if alive, gathering bit by bit above the mirror's surface to form a faint halo. Li Xiangping couldn't help but rub his eyes; it was as if all the most beautiful moonlight he had seen in his thirteen years was concentrated in that one spot.

"Father!" Li Xiangping whispered.

"Quiet!" Li Mutian's face paled. He forced his gaze away from the halo, his hands trembling violently. He shoved the mirror back at Li Xiangping and whispered urgently in his ear,

"Get inside. Tell your brothers to grab their blades and come out."

It was the first time Li Xiangping had ever seen such ruthless killing intent on his father's face. His eyes were narrowed slightly, like an eagle poised to strike.

"Yes..."

His voice trembled and his legs felt weak as he slowly edged back into the house.

The night was still peaceful as Li Xiangping pushed open the door to the room.

"Brothers... Father said to grab your weapons and get to the door. Quick."

Li Xiangping almost shouted, his voice trembling as he spoke in a low tone to his two brothers, who were leaning against the bed.

"What?!"

Li Changhu shot to his feet, steadying Li Xiangping with both hands and staring at him in concern.

"Is Father alright? Did he say what happened?"

Second Brother Li Tongya, however, rolled off the bed, pulling two blades from beneath it. He then grabbed the rattan armor and a long staff hanging on the wall, glanced grimly out the window, and said in a low voice,

"It must be enemies seeking revenge."

He handed the long blade and rattan armor to Li Changhu, kept the staff for himself, and clapped his elder brother on the shoulder.

"Brother, no more questions. Third Brother, you take Mother and Fourth Brother and hide in the backyard."

"Right."

Li Xiangping scrambled off to find their mother, while Li Changhu quickly calmed himself, donned the rattan armor, and walked toward the door, blade in hand.

Outside.

Li Mutian stood at the entrance, gazing quietly at the melon patch in front of the house. When both young men were standing behind him, he gestured and took the long blade from them.

"You two, split left and right. Scout the front and back of the house; make sure no one is around."

The two quickly affirmed and split up to investigate.

Li Mutian himself strode boldly into the melon patch, bent down, and hauled someone up from among the vines.
