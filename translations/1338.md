# Chapter 1338: Dragging into the Water

Li Zhouwei and the others set out immediately, traversing through the Great Void for a time. Yu Xixin stood to one side while Qiao Wenliu moved along with them, only to see this Purple Qi Great Daoist Master lag a step behind and silently soar to the other side, Qiao Wenliu’s expression did not change, simply holding the Azure Niche in his hand upright.

Though this scene passed in silence, Li Zhouwei saw it all. He understood that Daoist Master Yu likely held much displeasure, and Qiao Wenliu possessed a vile temper—perhaps his anger had dissipated earlier, but with this provocation, it surged up again.

This made him furrow his brows in secret.

'It is not without reason that Qiao Wenliu is unpopular... While he is certainly a capable individual, this mouth and this temper are not things one can rely on...'

Lesser Yin cultivators were extremely rare, and Qiao Wenliu’s skills were high. Li Zhouwei had intentions for him to teach Li Jiangchun, hence the added closeness, and he did not fear Li Jiangchun being led astray—after all, he was a sword immortal—but he feared that if personal relationships were ruined, it would not be beautiful, so he immediately noted this matter in his heart.

'If there is a chance... I still must persuade him with a sentence or two...'

Watching the two passes of Yun and Pu getting closer and closer, this King Wei rode upon the Heavenly Light, but suddenly felt a sensation.

Within the Great Void, a person was currently traveling towards them. His appearance was refined and gentle, his brows lowered and eyes cast down, deep in bitter thought, and he was spotted from afar, causing Li Zhouwei to laugh secretly in his heart.

"To think there would be a harvest!"

The next to react was precisely the Purple Qi Great Daoist Master. His divine ability seemed to have sensed something, and he raised his brows, saying,

"Xun Tiao... is this humble one's disciple."

Li Zhouwei, however, knew this name—previously, he had been guarding Guangping, only to abandon the city and flee after being beaten by Changyun, yet who would have thought he would be truly unlucky. He thought he was shuttling safely through this area, only to bump into this group.

He gave a slight nod, and Yu Xixin had already transformed into purple qi and departed. In merely a dozen breaths of time, he was seen riding the wind back, and standing behind him was that refined and gentle Daoist Master, head bowed and eyes lowered, not saying a word.

'Great Daoist Masters are truly useful!'

No matter where they went, the status of a Great Daoist Master would not be too low. People like Yu Xixin, while perhaps not able to command immediate obedience from everyone in Chun City, had formed broad ties of good karma. If Li Zhouwei had gone over, he might have had to deliver a harsh blow, but Yu Xixin went forward and merely showed his face to bring the person back obediently.

However, before the person even drew near, a rushing scent of cold snow and pine drifted over; this could be considered familiar, and without needing to ask, it was certainly the *Cold Qi* divine ability.

Yu Xixin only smiled:

"King Wei! This is my disciple, Xun Tiao of the Xun Clan. He is skilled at making incense and is also a rare talent..."

As soon as these words came out, Wu Miao was already muttering, cursing inwardly,

'Good, good, good, you bump into one while out and about, and it just happens to be your disciple, and you say you didn't come to surrender intentionally? You truly want no face at all; you just surrendered yourself, and now you rush to call your apprentice over too...'

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, but Qiao Wenliu bloomed with a smile. He seemed to be quite familiar with this young Daoist Master and hurriedly stepped forward, laughing,

"So it is Little Friend Xun... Long time no see..."

Xun Tiao only responded politely.

Qiao Wenliu was fond of lust, fond of Daoist books, and because he enjoyed burning incense for bedchamber matters, he was also fond of incense. Back when Li Zhouwei had captured him alive atop the city, he had actually been savoring incense with that Daoist Master of the Jiang Clan...

It was just that he never involved himself in the affairs of Chun City and did not know of this web of relationships, nor that he had offended the man's master. Now things became awkward again, but Li Zhouwei did not slow his pace, asking as he moved,

"What is happening at Mount Rao?"

Xun Tiao was startled, then gave a wry smile, saying,

"King Wei actually does not know. Everyone in Chun City thinks it was Your Majesty's layout!"

"Me?"

Li Zhouwei raised his brow, a somewhat surprised look in his expression, while Xun Tiao sighed silently,

"While King Wei fought a great battle in the east, Juan City secretly dispatched numerous divine abilities to circle around to the east and besiege Mount Rao, which is the cause of the current chaos!"

The group pondered silently, but Li Zhouwei had already come to a realization. The corner of his mouth hooked up into a smile, yet there was a strangeness in his eyes as he sighed, saying helplessly,

"No wonder I fought so easily in the north... Yehui could not restrain him, and Sima Yuanli also let him act recklessly... This kid has some wicked water in his belly; he actually plotted against his own people!"

......

Juan City.

Above the city walls, black clouds rolled, and layer upon layer of water-like colors surged forth to drown everything, like ocean tides, yet they were blocked and pushed back one by one by the several figures in the sky.

The fierce battle at Juan City had lasted a long time. The illusory colors were teetering on collapse, and heavy shades of water congealed on the other end, where one could see a person standing atop the waves—long beard and high cap, hair like ink, with a striking bearing, standing quietly at the head of the tide. His presence alone suppressed the entire majestic pass.

Converging Water Great Daoist Master, Gu You.

This Great Daoist Master possessed tyrannical strength and was supported by several divine abilities under his command. Even though Juan City was led by Changyun and Yehui, assisted by Yu Xi, Li Ximing, and others, and backed by a grand formation, it was still tottering, and everyone bore many injuries.

_Boom!_

Fortunately, a pillar of pitch-black light reaching through heaven and earth rushed up from the southern horizon. The emergence of Exiled Qi caused the anxious battle atop the city to stagnate, and that Converging Water Great Daoist Master raised his brows, a moment of hesitation in his eyes.

"Exiled Qi?"

"The Yang family has intervened?"

He was momentarily undecided, but the divine abilities around him were already fluctuating, transmitting the low voices of juniors,

"My Lord, Daoist Master Little Pang... transmits orders to cease hostilities... asking the Great Daoist Master to cut off the Great Void..."

"Sigh..."

Gu You shook his head and stepped silently into the Great Void. The tide in the sky became increasingly turbulent, binding the rays of light one by one to allow his side's divine abilities to escape. For a moment, heaven and earth shook, and darkness grew thick.

Atop the walls of Juan City, a crimson-robed man stood facing the wind. Those golden pupils quietly gazed at the horizon, his robes flapping noisily in the fierce wind brought by the tides, yet he did not move a muscle, staring intently at the sky.

There was not a shred of joy atop the city, only hesitation and gravity exchanged in glances. The man standing at the very front was dressed in black, a Holder of the Profound condensing his qi, looking extremely uneasy—it was the Marquis of Ping'an of the Great Song, Yang Ruizao!

This Marquis of Ping'an had always been on good terms with the Li family, but at this moment, his expression was exceptionally ugly. Seeing the pitch-black qi and raging flames rising slowly in the south, his hands abruptly clenched his robes, and he took a step forward, saying,

"First Highness! Blazing Fire has appeared! It must be... Longkang Yao!"

Those eyes flickered with astonishment and hidden anger, staring straight at the crimson-robed youth, until Li Jiangqian turned around, shook his head, and sighed.

"Blazing Fire has god-like speed! I was careless..."

The top of the city fell into instant silence.

Yang Ruizao did not know how to answer him for a moment, staring blankly. The youth standing behind him had outstanding looks and was dressed in green, surprisingly another acquaintance—the Sima Family's Holder of the Profound, Sima Xun.

Although this Holder of the Profound's expression was also unsightly, he was much more rational. He immediately bowed, speaking quite sincerely,

"The Lords are likely retreating this way. We do not know the extent of the casualties, so I still ask Your Highness to send people for rescue..."

The crimson-robed man's five fingers rested on the sword at his waist, tapping it lightly twice. Surprisingly, he did not speak immediately, and only when this direct descendant of the Sima family raised his head did he smile.

"Holder of the Profound need not worry... My father's beloved general, the Cui Clan's Daoist Master Cui Jueyin, is also in the east; I have long made an agreement with him that upon seeing fire, casualties must be reported. Since the jade talisman has not shattered, they are certainly fine."

Just then, Heavenly Light blazed in mid-air, a Daoist Master in white-gold robes descended upon the light, landing on the city wall. Upon seeing Li Ximing, Yang Ruizao's expression softened considerably, and he merely performed a greeting before turning to file a complaint, saying,

"Daoist Master... something has happened at Mount Rao!"

Li Ximing was silent and embarrassed.

Indeed, the initiator of the chaos at Mount Rao was precisely Li Jiangqian!

From the moment Li Zhouwei fought the great battle in the north and his aura surged to the heavens, this eldest son of King Wei keenly scented an opportunity for war. Li Jiangqian made an immediate decision, splitting off troops and dispatching Sima Yuanli, Li Jiangliang, Cui Jueyin, Zhong Qian, and others to ride out with full force, first circling west, then secretly heading east to attack Mount Rao!

Juan City was already in imminent danger, and this order was hard to accept for the masses. Li Jiangqian had pulled Yang Ruizao in at the time to make a joint promise, noting that Longkang Yao was already out, before obtaining consent.

At that time, Li Jiangqian had promised, "Led by Daoist Master Cui and Daoist Master Qinghu, they will feign an attack for a moment. Perhaps it can slightly relieve Father's siege. They will not stay long!"

If matters had come to an abrupt halt there, it could have been called the best of both worlds. But what these people had not expected was that the leaders, Cui Jueyin and Sima Yuanli, had long received secret orders from Li Jiangqian to delay again and again, seeming to have no intention of returning at all!

And it was precisely because Cui Jueyin, Sima Yuanli, and the others besieged Mount Rao for so long that Longkang Yao, who should have been waiting for an opportunity, received a constant stream of news. No longer lingering, he had to rush back south rapidly to return to his own assigned post, leaving High-Peak City in the north isolated and without aid.

As time passed, whether it was Yang Ruizao or Li Ximing, they more or less guessed his intentions, yet they did not find it strange and waited silently. But Li Jiangqian was cold and ruthless, transmitting not a bit of news, and Sima Yuanli and the others attacked for a long time without returning, actually getting caught right in the act by Longkang Yao, who had rushed back filled with fury!

And what would be the result of this?

Only at this moment did Yang Ruizao feel a chill rush up to his brows.

'Calculated... by this kid!'

Sima Yuanli, Li Jiangliang, Cui Jueyin, Zhong Qian... who were these people? Old officials of True Qi, the arm of the Song Emperor, loyal subordinate of King Wei, the Sect Master of Revering Radiance...

How could they be allowed to be lost?

With these people caught by a Great Daoist Master, how could Yang Ruiyi, who was stationed nearby in the Lotus Temple territory and originally not intervening in the struggle, merely acting as rear support, stand by and watch? How could he dare to sit on the wall and observe?!

This Great General of the Great Song, who had been sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight, had no choice but to act, blocking the furiously returning Longkang Yao. This was why Exiled Qi and Blazing Fire intertwined in the south, and the bloody color of the High Shaman lingered endlessly...

Because Yang Ruiyi and Longkang Yao had started fighting with real spears and swords! This was equivalent to transmitting a message to the entire North.

'Exiled Qi has intervened.'

This was also why Gu You and his group, who held the upper hand and were pushing their advantage, immediately hesitated. Unsure of the change in the situation for a moment, they even had to abandon their hard-won advantage and immediately retreat into the two eastern passes.

'Rotten through and through... evil to the extreme... He disregards life-mandates, actually being cold-hearted to this extent! From beginning to end, what this kid was thinking about was how to drag my Yang family, how to drag my Great Song into the water!'

No matter how close Yang Ruizao was to the Li family, he was still a member of the Yang family; how could his face not be completely dark!

Now that everything had been laid bare, Li Ximing also saw it clearly. He felt both the joy of the siege being broken and an indescribable emotion, mixed with some unease. At this moment, he could only bow deeply, sighing.

"Jiangqian... does not understand worldly affairs and obstructed military intelligence, causing the East to suffer disaster... I only hope there are no casualties... I still hope the Marquis of Ping'an can be magnanimous..."

Seeing Li Ximing come to apologize, the youth who had been smiling consistently with a hint of guilt and showing no change finally reacted. His brows furrowed slightly, the guilt in his eyes deepened, and he simply clasped both hands behind his back.

'Unhappy about this?'

'My father campaigns north and south, fighting east and west for your Great Song, unable to attend to head and tail, yet have I seen you furrow a brow? How much did I offend you by designing Yang Ruiyi to enter the board... What a joke! When you people taught me time and again to use Moongaze Lake as bait... did you ever think about offending us!'

Discussion was rife, and this Highness was extremely remorseful. He simply took this Yang family member's hand and sighed,

"A thousand wrongs, ten thousand mistakes, it is my fault... I underestimated this Great Daoist Master... I originally thought that once fighting broke out in the east, it would inevitably cause chaos on all sides, and with Father surrounded on left and right, they would not be willing to retreat without heavily injuring them... I never thought of today..."

He patted Yang Ruizao's shoulder lightly, then looked at Sima Xun beside him, murmuring,

"Presumably, Father achieved victory through surprise, conversely injuring him. That is why he fled back. Since he is injured, his divine ability must be greatly reduced, and with the Great General constantly watching by his side, there will certainly be no major issues!"

Sima Xun did not care whether the Yang family intervened or not; it wasn't his Sima family forcing people into the field. On second thought, if the Yang family intervened, his Sima family would have an easier time. The only thing he cared about was the safety of Daoist Master Qinghu, so he also raised his hand to persuade Yang Ruizao, whose expression changed several times, wanting to speak but stopping.

Li Jiangqian continued with guilt, "Fortunately, it is just offending one Longkang Yao, not a major matter... Once the Great General gathers the troops and returns, the various cultivators of the North will also see clearly."

With honey on his lips and a sword in his belly, standing outside the matter and watching coldly, his heart was instead full of cold sneers.

'Yang Ruiyi... sitting on the mountain watching tigers fight, as if he's so amazing! What a big favor! Not wanting to offend people... When the Great Song goes on campaign, has my father ever sat by and watched? What, my Li family can be offended, but your Yang family cannot?'

His words were soft, and the matter was already irreversible. While Yang Ruizao was secretly furious, he was unwilling to extravagantly use his relationship with the Li family to vent anger for the Yang Clan, so he could only keep a sullen face and sigh.

"Everyone misunderstands! How can this be a calculation of Ruizao alone! The Emperor mobilized the various cultivators, and I followed orders to come north together, originally bearing a bit of duty as a supervisor. Now that spilled water cannot be gathered, we still must think of how to explain this to the Great General!"

Yet the crimson-robed youth did not care in the slightest. His gaze had already shifted from the rolling billows of flame in the east to the north. Looking at the dawning sky, a smile was already on his face as he said,

"Two Seniors need not worry. If not outside my expectations, Father has already led people here. Within a short while, we will certainly be able to attack from left and right, smashing the two passes!"

The two were startled simultaneously, shifting their gazes to him. Within Li Jiangqian's golden eyes, there was no panic or guilt, only a faint joy. His gaze swept across the horizon as he said casually,

"If there are any casualties that shake the people's hearts, I will certainly ask the Great General for punishment. If they return safely and we have seized the opportunity for war to smash the Zhao people, what explanation is needed..."

His posture softened, but his tone hardened, his eyes completely calm.

"I fear I must trouble the Great General to go speak with King Wei."
