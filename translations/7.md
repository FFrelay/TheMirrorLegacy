# Chapter 7: Techniques

Early morning.

The dazzling morning light leaped from Mount Dali, caressing the golden expanse of Moongaze Lake. A breeze swept over the endless, overlapping reed marsh, carrying the sound of children laughing and playing on the Meichi River.

Chen Erniu sat on the field ridge, gazing worriedly at the crops, his thoughts on his wife lying sick in bed.

Chen Erniu was born in Lichuankou, east of Mount Dali. Over twenty years ago, a great drought had inexplicably struck the flatlands of Lichuankou.

Not a drop of rain fell, and white steam even hissed from the earth, terrifying the villagers into scattering.

He was only a half-grown boy at the time and fled in a daze to Lijing Village. After his desperate pleas, a farmer named Li Genshui took him in, and the following year even rented him a mu of land so he could survive.

When he was older, he rented an additional mu of paddy field, built an earthen house, and married Li Genshui's daughter, establishing himself respectably in the village.

But his wife had suddenly fallen ill. Fortunately, he had some savings from over the years. He carried her to the village entrance for Mr. Han to examine—it was just a minor illness, requiring only a few doses of medicine.

He left his wife in Mr. Han's care, but his anxious heart couldn't rest.

'One illness can impoverish three generations!'

"Uncle!" Chen Erniu was lost in thought when a hearty voice startled him.

He saw a handsome young man walking toward the courtyard entrance, a warm smile on his face as he waved.

"Ah, Changhu, I don't deserve such respect, I really don't!"

Chen Erniu bowed repeatedly. He had only married a concubine-born daughter of the Li family and was also their tenant; he truly didn't deserve to be addressed this way by the eldest son.

Li Genshui had been shrewd and capable, but also quite the philanderer. Marrying a wife wasn't enough; he had also taken in two other women as concubines.

His wife bore him two sons, while the concubines bore him three sons and four daughters.

Back then, when Li Genshui was old and near death, the only legitimate son still with him suddenly died. His several concubine-born sons, young and robust, eyed the family's dozen or so mu of land covetously.

Just then, Mutian, who had run away from home, returned with his men, blades in hand. The ferocious old soldier cut down the disloyal steward in a single blow. The wealthy family that had poisoned his brother and planned to annex their lands was utterly slaughtered; not even a dog was spared.

Mutian and his two friends, carrying blood-drenched blades, dragged the corpses on a pushcart, leaving a gory trail from one end of the village to the other. Every household shuttered its doors, and terror gripped the heart of every villager.

Mutian's younger half-brothers were panic-stricken, assuming that with the rightful heir's return, they would surely lose any claim to the land.

Who would have known that Mutian would summon his half-brothers, declare that legitimate and concubine-born sons were all branches of the same tree, and divide the wealthy family's land among them, giving two mu to each? He then gave four mu each to the brothers-in-arms he had brought back. Overwhelmed with gratitude, his half-brothers repeatedly addressed him as "Main House Elder Brother," and thus, the family hierarchy was settled.

Looking at Li Changhu's gentle smile, it somehow overlapped with the memory of Mutian's indifferent, blood-splattered face. Chen Erniu shivered despite the hot sun and asked respectfully:

"Changhu, what brings you here?"

"Ah, Uncle, you're being too formal." Li Changhu smiled and said softly, "I heard Auntie is ill. Father figured you wouldn't have time to cook, so he sent me to invite you and Little Ze to our house to try my mother's-cooking."

"This... I'd feel too embarrassed." Chen Erniu forced a smile, caught in a dilemma.

"It's settled! Mother has already prepared the meal." Li Changhu clapped Chen Erniu on the shoulder and departed.

"Alright then." Chen Erniu smiled and shook his head, calling into the house:

"Little Ze, get ready! We're going to your uncle's house for dinner tonight."

The Li family had finished renovating their residence the year before last, expanding its footprint several times over. The entire compound faced south in a rectangular layout. The front courtyard was paved with stone bricks and held heavy stone locks, looking like a martial arts training ground. Chen Erniu observed the considerable weight of the stone locks and couldn't help but click his tongue in admiration:

"Does the Li family also have a martial arts discipline? What impressive stone locks."

He crossed the stone bricks into the main courtyard. A pond was built in the center, holding a few black carp. The main hall, framed in bluestone, was flanked by the adjoining rooms of Li Changhu and Li Tongya. The bases of the buildings, covered walkways, and gates were all laid with stone slabs or steps, looking incredibly stately.

Li Tongya came out to greet them and entered the main courtyard as well. He was already eighteen but had not yet taken a wife.

Li Changhu, however, had married the second daughter of the Ren family, bringing her into the household with great fanfare some time ago.

After dinner, Chen Erniu sat in the courtyard making idle conversation with the Li family. Suddenly, he saw Li Chejing hurry into the front courtyard, lean close to Mutian's ear, and whisper a few words.

Li Chejing was only nine years old, but he was strikingly handsome and had an air of sharp intelligence, making him a favorite among his uncles and brothers.

Mutian was leisurely watching the younger generation chat when he heard Li Chejing whisper in his ear:
"Father, the... the medallion... it's lit!"

His expression unchanged, he patted his legs and announced to the others:

"I'm getting old, it seems I can't sit still for long. I'll go rest; you all continue chatting."

With that, he turned and headed to the rear courtyard. The others quickly acknowledged him, and Chen Erniu bowed, preparing to take his leave as well.

Behind the main hall stood several side rooms. Mutian entered the ancestral hall, the largest and most central of the buildings. Inside, spirit tablets stood at the front, adorned with offerings of fruit, honoring the six generations of ancestors they had managed to identify from the village annals.

Mutian pushed a section of the wall, revealing a hidden compartment behind it.

The compartment had a skylight, allowing moonlight to spill onto a platform built of bluestone.

On the platform sat a blue-gray bronze mirror, which was, just as reported, shining brightly with a fluid, white light.

"Three years... Jing'er, go and call all your older brothers."

Mutian said, frowning as he stared at the blue-gray bronze mirror.

"Yes." Li Chejing nodded firmly and went out to find his brothers.

When Lu Jiangxian awoke, his mind was heavy, stuffed with information. He took an incense stick's worth of time to recover before he began to calmly read the information from the Jade Stone.

The Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra!
This technique primarily taught how to control the spiritual qi of heaven and earth through the body's "apertures," draw upon the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, and finally cultivate the six wheels of Embyronic Breathing. With these six wheels, one could extend their life, nourish their nature, and cast all manner of Dharma Arts.

Once the six wheels were nourished to resemble a full moon, one could enter the Qi Refining realm.

It was followed by several minor spell arts, such as the Golden Light Art, Cleansing Art, Water-Averting Technique, Evil-Dispelling Art, and Mind-Link Art. As long as one had cultivated the six wheels, these could be cast by circulating spiritual qi according to the technique.

The technique also described the six realms of cultivation: Embyronic Breathing, Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment Realm, Purple Mansion Realm, Golden Core, and Origin-Infant.

What this Jade Stone recorded was the Embyronic Breathing wheel-nourishing method from the Moonlight Origin Mansion, an immortal abode in the Yue State, distributed to its disciples for their cultivation.

After devouring the Jade Stone, Lu Jiangxian felt he had grasped many new things. Not only had his spiritual sense expanded to a range of twenty zhang, but his upper limit of lunar brilliance power had also multiplied dozens of times. As long as he had sufficient lunar brilliance power, he could even cast the minor spell arts from the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra within one zhang of the mirror's body.

Most importantly, a Dharma Art had surfaced from within the mirror's own memories, called:

The Profound Pearl Spirit-Ritual Art!
