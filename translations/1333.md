# Chapter 1333: Heavenly Derivation

'Longkang Yao...'

The colors in the sky had already dimmed, the Heavenly Light receding. Li Zhouwei stood with his arms folded, his thoughts growing ever deeper.

'A Great Daoist Master of Blazing Fire.'

Li Zhouwei had fought arduous battles from north to south, witnessing countless divine abilities. Xueyang and Murong Weidian's divine abilities were perfected, while Suiguan and Dongfang Heyun were beyond the mundane. He had not truly crossed hands with many Great Daoist Masters, yet he had witnessed a fair number of their battles.

'Among the four-divine-ability masters I have seen thus far, this Great Daoist Master of Blazing Fire likely stands alone at the very top when it comes to combat...'

The man's Dharma Body was nothing short of terrifying!

'A Great Daoist Master of the manifest Blazing Fire, one who walks a path toward the ultimate Dharma Body, equipped with a top-tier feathered robe from a grotto-heaven, a complete set of astounding Spiritual Treasures, possessing the Dao-Profundity of a Great Daoist Master, and the knowledge of a direct descendant of the Three Profoundities...'

The man's Dharma Body was not overwhelmingly powerful on its own. In a physical confrontation, a punch landing on Li Zhouwei's Sovereign Treading Peril would not have caused so much as a ripple. Yet with all these enhancements, it was simply 'tough.'

Burning the Old Chamber also possessed a divisive power, which meant this Great Daoist Master could easily fight many opponents at once, and even display an ability akin to the great power of 'Immunity to All Arts' before those with lesser divine abilities.

'This is a true descendant of Comprehending Profundity...'

Li Zhouwei had actually met another such individual, Wang Ziya of the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. He too was considered a direct descendant of Comprehending Profundity, yet the difference between the two men was vast. That old Daoist was less a Great Daoist Master and more a reclusive hermit who had secluded himself from the world to cultivate.

'Fortunately, through this battle, I have managed to see some of his shortcomings.'

Li Zhouwei's own Dao-Profundity had advanced another step, allowing him to perceive his opponent's condition with perfect clarity. If Li Zhouwei's assessment was correct, the man was afraid of being injured!

'Blazing Fire is unlike Pristine Water. Pristine Water contains a measure of yin energy, its virtue lying in nourishment. Even if one is wounded, it can suppress the injury and promote recovery. But Blazing Fire is excessively vigorous. When a fire burns too brightly, its fuel is quickly consumed, and it cannot last long.'

The man's Dharma Body was indeed formidable, but once it sustained an injury, recovery was bound to be exceedingly difficult, and it would surely become a liability in a prolonged battle. In their fight, it was difficult for Li Zhouwei to gravely wound him, but the methods Longkang Yao possessed to harm Li Zhouwei were also few and far between!

'Even if he hails from a grotto-heaven and uses all his resources to procure all sorts of sacred healing medicines, the slow recovery speed is unavoidable. If I were to continue battling him, his wounds would gradually accumulate until the Emissary of Aridity has nothing left to parch and Burning the Old Chamber has nothing left to burn. There would come a time when he withers and I flourish, and I would surely make him enter my Imperial Observation of the Origin.'

'That would mean gambling on when the people from High-Peak City would arrive. He did not take that gamble, nor did he have any need to gamble with me, which is why he left...'

He fell silent for a moment, gradually formulating a strategy for his next battle with this man, a clarity dawning in his heart.

'If I can fight him again within a few months and see whether his injuries have recovered, I will be able to verify if my judgment is correct...'

Unaware of his thoughts, Qiao Wenliu approached and said softly,

"There is something Your Majesty may not know... Lord Longkang comes from the Longkang clan and is a descendant of the Divine Slaying True Monarch. That Dharma Body is called the of the Dragon-Slaying Blazing Transformation Dharma Body... Back when both were in the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, he fought a duel with the old Daoist Master Murong, and even with that old master's profound sword techniques, he could not be seriously injured..."

"Murong Weidian?"

Seeing him nod, Li Zhouwei said with disappointment, "That Daoist Master cultivates Valley Water. No matter how skilled he is in combat, asking a Valley Water master to injure a Blazing Fire master is asking the impossible."

He paid no mind to these rumors. Below, Wu Miao had already activated his divine ability, holding the Azure Niche in his palm as he strode forward with the wind. He offered a salute, and the Azure Niche rapidly enlarged, revealing the person within.

Jiang Fuwang's face was slightly pale, with blood on his lips. He stood amidst dense Lesser Yin energy, his head lowered in silence. In but a moment, Qiao Wenliu had already suppressed his divine ability and hurried forward.

The Jiang Clan was one of the few Immortal Clans with whom Qiao Wenliu had a good relationship. For many years, only the Jiang Clan had been willing to befriend him. Qiao Wenliu displayed an attitude entirely different from how he treated Wen Daoping, not only retracting his Spiritual Treasure but also showing a look of concern.

"Fellow Daoist Jiang!"

Jiang Fuwang nodded at him, then quickly looked toward Li Zhouwei and said with a wry smile,

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Having been captured in an ambush, Jiang Fuwang was not actually panicked, and he had even considered that Li Zhouwei could swiftly defeat Longkang Yao and capture him. Yet now that this moment had truly arrived, he still felt a sense of desolation in his heart.

Who was Longkang Yao?

He had been the top genius of the Longkang clan, receiving immense attention and having been steeped in heavenly resources and earthly treasures since childhood. Li Zhouwei's destiny was certainly unusual, but Longkang Yao, as a descendant of the 'True Monarch of Divine Blazing Aridity' from ancient times, even if his bloodline was no longer prominent, was now a Great Daoist Master of Blazing Fire. Was he really that much inferior?

If Longkang Yao just stood there, how many cultivators could even harm him? Logically speaking, the worst-case scenario should have been him stalling until Daoist Master Yu from High-Peak City arrived as reinforcement!

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist Jiang, I trust you've been well since we last met."

Jiang Fuwang remained silent.

The battle at Luoxia had been swift and sudden, but if one were to count, there was the first time at Aiding City, and while Daoist Master Jia had given the warning at Liangchuan, it must have been with this King Wei's permission. Li Zhouwei had already spared him twice. This was the third time his life had fallen into this King Wei's hands.

If the Jiang Clan held an irreconcilable grudge against Bright Yang, he would not fear death. However, the Jiang Clan bore no ill will towards Bright Yang. In truth, the ideology of the Jiang Clan's Encompassing Profundity Heavenly Derivation and the Wei Emperor's Dao-path were actually closest in philosophy. Once this King Wei galloped across the central plains, whether by the origins of their legal lineage or the philosophy of their Daoist traditions, it would be impossible for the Jiang Clan not to support him.

As a direct descendant of the Jiang Clan, Jiang Fuwang naturally had his pride. If he had been defeated in the first battle, he could have certainly put on a defiant act, as this King Wei was unlikely to kill him. But now, he, a master of two divine abilities, had already received the mercy of a Great Daoist Master three times.

'Any further posturing would be to humiliate both him and myself.'

He sighed softly and said, "Fuwang is willing to serve Bright Yang."

A flicker of light moved in Li Zhouwei's eyes as he noted that this Daoist Master referred to Bright Yang and not King Wei. He raised an eyebrow and said,

"Good!"

Qiao Wenliu was already beaming with joy. He put away his Spiritual Treasure and said,

"Fellow Daoist Jiang, in Chun City, you were merely occupying a position without fulfilling its duties, a wine sack and a rice bag living off profound grace. Your willingness to follow His Majesty is the true path to achieving great things!"

Jiang Fuwang, who was not a lone wanderer like him, showed almost no joy on his face. He could only nod silently, yet he saw that this King Wei still had a thoughtful expression and did not ask any questions, but instead opened his mouth to say,

"Daoist Master Jiang, in your opinion, where should we go now?"

'It's unavoidable after all...'

Bitterness welled in Jiang Fuwang's heart, but the look in his eyes slowly grew solemn. In an instant, he steeled his resolve, casting all other thoughts behind him, and said calmly,

"Once Daoist Master Longkang withdrew, he would have certainly returned to the south. The four directions are now empty. In my opinion, we can only cross the prefectures to the west and swiftly take High-Peak City, where Daoist Master Yu is located..."

"Daoist Master Yu? Yu Xixin?"

Seeing that a third Great Daoist Master had emerged, Qiao Wenliu felt a headache coming on and cursed,

"Usually, you can't find a single one of them, but now they're all rushing to show up..."

Jiang Fuwang said, "Although Daoist Master Yu is in High-Peak City, he is a cautious person and is unlikely to advance east rashly. He is most likely still holding his position..."

Li Zhouwei nodded, "Correct."

This was not an easy bone to chew. Li Zhouwei did not fear being surrounded by these divine ability masters, but he disliked them gathering around a Great Daoist Master, occupying several key points and defending from fortified cities.

But with Bian Fan now holding his position nearby, it was a rare opportunity. This bone had to be chewed, whether he liked it or not. Li Zhouwei simply said,

"Go!"

In an instant, several figures with divine abilities submerged into the Great Void, speeding westward. Amidst the shifting colors of light, this King Wei finally found the time to speak, asking softly,

"The Jiang Clan... what are its origins?"

Jiang Fuwang returned a salute and said,

"The Jiang Clan serves within the Heavenly Derivation Dao-path of the White Ritual Daoist tradition, under the Encompassing Profundity Great Dao."

"Heavenly Derivation?"

Li Zhouwei's expression flickered slightly. As expected, he heard Qiao Wenliu let out a soft sigh, revealing a look of extreme reverence as he said,

"Immortal Lord Qingyi!"

Qingyi!

The disciple of the Profound Master of Encompassing Profundity, the master of Heaven–Governing, the owner of the 'My Dao's Heaven-Governing Heavenly Gate,' the very foundation of the Encompassing Profundity's supervision over the world.

Li Zhouwei had of course heard of his name. It was spoken by that fox-kin himself back then. Even... the Heavenly Element currently held by the Li Clan's Li Suining and Liu Changdie, who was still in the west, was but one ten-thousandth of what He had bestowed! This Immortal Lord's weight, within Encompassing Profundity and even the entire world, both within and Beyond the Profound, was astonishingly heavy.

In his campaigns across the north and south, no matter what illustrious background Li Zhouwei heard of, he would merely nod. Only this Jiang Clan could make him look over with a hint of surprise, as he asked,

"A descendant of Qingyi?"

Jiang Fuwang was startled and quickly waved his hands, saying,

"Immortal Lord Qingyi did not bear any children. The Chunyu clan and the Jiang Clan share a deep connection... but we would not dare to call ourselves descendants of Qingyi..."

Li Zhouwei raised his brows, unwilling to let it go, and asked softly,

"What sort of connection?"

This question made the other two men beside him prick up their ears. Clearly, this was a secret that even they were not privy to. Jiang Fuwang paused for only a moment, then performed a salute in the empty air before saying with a serious expression,

"My Jiang Clan is a great surname from high antiquity. Immortal Lord Qingyi was originally of the Jiang Clan as well, with the clan having spread throughout the lands of Qi. It was only that at that time, a revered one achieved the Dao, and to avoid their taboo name, the Immortal Lord changed his surname to Chunyu, and so that entire branch changed their immortal surname..."

"So there is such a history!"

Li Zhouwei was slightly shaken. He re-evaluated the man before him and said,

"Remarkable.."

Qiao Wenliu stared at him blankly, speechless.

'It's not that your family shares a surname with the Immortal Lord, it's that the Immortal Lord originally shared a surname with your family...'

If the words of the man before him were true, then to put it bluntly, one didn't even need to trace back to high antiquity. Just a few thousand years ago, during the reign of the Thunder Palace, his Jiang Clan would have been noble beyond all measure. With the tyrannical style of Encompassing Profundity, they would have had to arrive in thunder carriages and, upon a visit to Gu Prefecture, would likely have had all divine ability masters kneel to meet them!

'That would be like the Xue Clan of today, or even far surpassing the Xue Clan of today! I, Qiao Wenliu, wouldn't even be qualified to befriend him. I would be miserably preparing gifts, begging him to lessen the thunder's might, and would still fail. Just to see him once, I would have to respectfully say, "I have received the immortal grace face-to-face"...'

His heart was filled with shock.

'After all, the Xue Clan still cares about face regarding immortals and mortals, the mortal affairs, and the like. Encompassing Profundity has always been direct, calling a spade a spade. Whether it's Bright Yang or the Thunder Palace, they're all cut from the same cloth. A descendant of an Immortal Lord who has shown great grace to the world is of unspeakably high statu. They would definitely make you kneel to see them!'

Qiao Wenliu swallowed hard.

'Only... only in more recent times, if this King Wei were an imperial son and the Thunder Palace had long since declined, would he then be qualified to sit and discuss the Dao with fellow Daoist Jiang, calling him brother.... As for the rest of us, what right would we have to even stand in his presence!'

'I used to think that the Jiang Clan's current respect and nobility weren't too bad, but looking at it this way, it's not just bad, this status in Gu Prefecture's Chun City is the goddamn lowest point for the Jiang Clan since ancient times...'

At this moment, the Great Void was still silent. An unknown amount of time passed before Qiao Wenliu was heard saying hoarsely,

"Your esteemed clan has truly kept this a tight secret!"

Jiang Fuwang seemed to have expected this outcome. He lowered his head without speaking, his eyes showing neither pride nor disappointment, only a vast calmness. After a long while, he finally smiled quietly and said,

"Its rise was swift, and its fall sudden. It is not worth mentioning."

...

The light shimmered, and the lake was beautiful.

The setting sun gradually descended upon the water's surface, making the small pavilion on the shore appear even more radiant. A person could be seen seated within, enthusiastically painting with a brush.

A middle-aged man walked up from above, offered a salute, and said respectfully,

"My lord..."

The old man raised his eyebrows, looked at him, and appeared to be in an excellent mood, saying,

"So it is Daoist Master Pang who has come... Sit... Come, sit!"

The middle-aged man had no choice but to enter. He saw the old man push the painting over for him to see. On it was depicted a pavilion, soaring into the clouds and surrounded by a Treasure Light. The old man smiled and said,

"This object is something I copied from the lord's own hand. What do you think? In my view... this painting alone could be used to face an enemy. This is the great divine ability of our predecessors!"

This person was precisely the old Daoist Master Qu, who had obtained the True Monarch's own writing from the Yao family. After returning from the Ji River and having a detailed discussion with Yao Guanyi, he had sent that lord on his way and had since hidden himself in the pavilion, engrossed in his own painting, refusing to see anyone.

Hearing these words, the sentence the middle-aged man was about to say was stuffed back down his throat. He frowned, lowered his head to look, and revealed a thoughtful expression. After a long while, he suddenly came to his senses and said,

"Old Daoist Master! Li Zhouwei has broken through Xuan Chao and gone west!"

He smiled and said,

"It is just as Lord Longkang predicted. The encirclement has now moved north. No matter where the great battle takes place, there will be two Great Daoist Masters making a move, and with Lord Longkang present, there should be news of victory."

"Hah!"

The old Daoist Master raised his head in confusion and said, "What Li Zhouwei? What Xuan Chao?"

The middle-aged man was taken aback, looking at him with a mixture of shock and suspicion, and said,

"Old senior! You sent my son to the western passes of Yun and Pu. Now the great battle has begun, and that city is in grave danger. King Wei went east long ago... It's just that there's been no movement from the north... You... you..."

"Oh... I see now."

The old man nodded and praised, "King Wei's use of troops is divinely swift!"

These few words gave the middle-aged man an extremely ominous premonition. He looked the person before him up and down and said, "Naturally.."

This instantly wiped away Daoist Master Pang's good mood. He became inexplicably anxious, pacing back and forth in the pavilion with his hands behind his back. Several times he was about to speak, but upon noticing that the old man was still focused on his painting, a flame of anger naturally ignited in his heart.

They were both masters of divine abilities in the Purple Mansion Realm; an attitude could often reveal many things. Daoist Master Pang cursed inwardly.

'This old fool changes his tune faster than flipping a book. He doesn't want to get involved!'

He suddenly remembered something, frowned, and said in a cold voice,

"Old senior... I heard you went to the Ji River. Might you tell this junior... on the Ji River, that King Wei... did he say anything?"

This question made the old man's eyelids twitch. He finally stopped the brush in his hand, gently placing it on the table, and assumed a thoughtful posture. After a long while, he looked up, his eyes filled with turbidity.

Daoist Master Pang stared at him intently, watching as the old man opened his mouth in the sunset and said quietly,

"I do not remember."
