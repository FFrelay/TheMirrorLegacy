# Chapter 2: The Li Family

Li Mutian woke during the Hour of the Tiger, staring wide-eyed at his dilapidated roof, where a faint glimmer pierced the pitch-black darkness.

The roof had sprung a small leak a few days prior, but Li Mutian hadn't found the time to repair it. He hadn't slept well for three straight days. Looking at the woman sleeping like the dead beside him, Li Mutian heaved a deep sigh.

'This woman just doesn't grasp the gravity of it. The other day, those high-and-mighty immortals were flying about Mount Dali like madmen, practically wishing they could scour the earth three feet deep. It scared everyone half to death; we all knelt and kowtowed every time a streak of light passed...'

Li Mutian’s brow furrowed, his heart filled with anxiety. The few small villages at the foot of Mount Dali had always been carefree, but these past days, everyone was on edge, living in constant fear.

'The mountains are remote and the roads narrow; the imperial court doesn't govern us, and we don't bother with them. But when these immortals fight, a single immortal technique could wipe Lijing Village clean, leaving not even a dog behind.'

Li Mutian rolled over, sleep now impossible, and rose to gaze out the window at the dense night.

'My boys are growing bigger by the day, eating more and more at every meal. Tomorrow, I'll send one of them to the Meichi River to catch some fish and crabs.'

'If we're struck down by an immortal technique one day, it's simply fate. The Li family has tilled this wilderness for over two hundred years; our ancestors are buried here, we can't just leave.'

Li Mutian lowered his gaze and shook his head, clasping his hands behind his back as he stepped outside.

The big yellow dog outside was still fast asleep. Li Mutian walked slowly through the thin morning mist, watching Lijing Village awaken to the sound of roosters crowing, dogs barking, and the sight of curling chimney smoke.

“Xiangping—!” Li Mutian shouted toward the sidehouse at the top of his lungs. A clatter echoed from within, the main door flew open, and a half-grown boy stumbled out, grumbling.

"Father!" Li Xiangping's features were rather fine, his eyes shrewd, and he tilted his head back to look up at Li Mutian.

"What's the chore for today?"

Li Mutian waved his hand and said, "Go to the Meichi River and catch some fish and crabs. There's no heavy chores today. Just get your mother something fresh to eat."

"Alright!"

Li Xiangping nodded excitedly, snatching up a woven basket and a long-pronged spear before dashing off.

Li Mutian chuckled twice and headed for the fields.

————

The Meichi River was both shallow and wide, its banks lined with vast mudflats and reeds. The villagers raised geese and ducks by the score, and there was no need to feed them; released in the morning, they all flocked to the river.

In the evening, someone would walk to the riverbank and call out. The birds were all well-tamed and accustomed to the sound, and they would all trail along back home.

When Li Xiangping arrived, the flocks had not yet been released, leaving the Meichi River deserted. Two small wooden rafts bobbed by the shore. He rolled up his trouser legs and sleeves, knelt into the silt, and began groping blindly with his hands. Fixing his gaze on the water, he spotted a flash of green.

'A good fish.'

Li Xiangping lunged, holding his breath as he plunged his arms into the water. His right hand clamped down, securing a firm grip on the green-tailed fish by its gills, and he hauled it up.

"Heh heh."

Li Xiangping laughed, tossing the fish into his basket. The local river fish were certainly not this slow. This green-tail was most likely a wild fish that had washed down from upstream, allowing the boy to snag an easy prize.

Glancing down toward his feet, Li Xiangping's expression grew puzzled. The riverbed beneath him felt unusually smooth in one spot, and he could see a faint, silvery glint.

Just as he was preparing to hold his breath and dive down to investigate, a loud voice called out from the bank.

“Brother Xiangping!”

Li Xiangping instinctively hid the basket behind his back and looked toward the shore, where a boy of about ten years emerged from the reeds.

“Little Ye, here to let out the ducks?”

"Mhm!"

His younger cousin, Li Yesheng, nodded obediently and said with a smile, "I heard the strangest thing this morning. A huge stag was bitten by a snake and died right at the village entrance. Its antlers were as big as a table; it was terrifying."

Li Xiangping listened to his chatter, letting out a quiet breath of relief, and held the basket forward.

"Look at this green-tail. Caught it with my bare hands."

"What a fish!" Li Yesheng peered into the basket, his voice full of envy.

Li Yesheng's father was perpetually bedridden, and his own older brother was a good-for-nothing, meaning they often didn't know where their next meal was coming from. He frequently had to go to his uncle Li Mutian's home for food, and his cousin Li Xiangping had always treated him like a blood brother.

After chatting for a moment, Li Yesheng shook his head.

"Alright, brother, I have to get back to the ducks. If I lose even one, my brother will beat me half to death."

"Go on, go on."

Li Xiangping, anxious to investigate the object in the riverbed, quickly shooed him off.

"Got it!"

The moment his cousin left, Li Xiangping took a deep breath and plunged to the river bottom. He swept his hands back and forth across the silt and, sure enough, his fingers closed around a round object.

_Phlup._

Li Xiangping surfaced, wiping the water from his face to get a good look at the object.

It was roughly the size of his palm, with a small, gray-blue disc at its center, encircled by what looked like a dark iron rim. There was nothing remarkable about it.

The front was shattered into seven or eight pieces, held together only by the rim. The back, however, bore a rather strange symbol, though Li Xiangping studied it for a long time and couldn't make out what it was.

'It looks a bit like my aunt's bronze mirror.'

Li Xiangping’s aunt’s family owned the most land, so she was the only one who could afford a mirror; other village women made do with their reflections in the water. His mother had even taken him to see it when his aunt first got it, and it was indeed much more convenient than water.

But this mirror in his hand was far too blurry; it was completely fogged over, revealing nothing. Li Xiangping shook his head in disappointment, tossed the object into his basket, and went back to catching fish.

————

Lu Jiangxian had already been in the water for the better part of a month. The influx of lunar essence had stagnated after the third day, and though he had struggled for another week, he had made no progress whatsoever. He could do nothing but emit a faint glow.

That morning, he had been staring blankly at the large green fish beside him when a massive hand suddenly slammed it into the silt. The water shuddered, and a hand gripped the fish by the gills, lifting it away.

Lu Jiangxian was still processing the complex emotions of encountering a living person for the first time when that same large hand scooped up his true body.

Seeing a large, rather handsome face loom over him, Lu Jiangxian felt a surge of nervousness. The boy chattered incomprehensibly for a moment before casually tossing him into the basket, leaving him to stare face-to-face with the green-tailed fish.

In that instant, Lu Jiangxian realized a serious problem—he could hear, but he could not necessarily understand.

The local accent sounded something like the Min-Zhe dialects from his previous life, and he couldn't understand a single word. This meant that even if he could somehow produce sound, they wouldn't understand him either, which would severely hinder his ability to integrate into this world.

As he watched more small fish being tossed into the basket, Lu Jiangxian focused his essence and calmed his spirit, attempting to perceive his surroundings.

As he watched the boy carefully raise a wooden spear, Lu Jiangxian made a soft sound of surprise. From this perspective, he could vaguely perceive the boy's mental activity—specifically, which fish on the riverbed had captured his attention.

With the aid of this perceptive insight, he listened as the boy muttered to himself after each catch. Before long, Lu Jiangxian had already grasped the local pronunciations for the numbers three through six, as well as the names for different types of fish.

'I'll just have to take it one step at a time.'

Watching the boy stand up and leave, Lu Jiangxian sighed. The child looked as if he came from a farming family, which meant he would probably hand an object made of this bronze-like material over to his parents first.

'I need more contact with people. I'll see if I can slowly learn the local dialect and, while ensuring my own safety, find a method to increase my lunar essence.'
