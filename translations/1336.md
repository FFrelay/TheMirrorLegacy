# Chapter 1336: Omen of the Dao

The sky was a somber grey.

Mountains rose and fell, earth veins gathered, and the Great Void was thick and heavy. The four borders were secure and solid, revealing a city with towering walls, impregnable as metal and stone. Various spiritual veins converged here; it should have been a land of concentrated spiritual beauty, a dwelling for immortal cultivators.

Yet at this moment, above the majestic city, the sky was filled with eerie flames. Bolt after bolt of lightning flickered upon the great formation, clashing against the vast golden light and emitting waves of trembling sound, causing the great formation to flicker between brightness and darkness, shaking unceasingly.

_Boom!_

Golden radiance descended from the heavens once more, transforming into a towering Heavenly Gate that ruthlessly suppressed the formation array. Beneath the Heavenly Gate, a young man held a long battle axe, looking down with a dispassionate gaze.

Beside him, a Daoist Master in silver furs held a jade disk in one hand while his other hand performed divinations. Silver light flowed within his eyes as he spoke in a low voice,

"King Wei, be careful... this array has reached its limit; someone is bound to come out to meet us!"

Li Zhouwei raised his head and asked, "What are this person's divine abilities?"

He was naturally speaking of the Great Daoist Master within the array. On the other side, Wu Miao whispered,

"King Wei... there are only a few Great Daoist Masters in Gu Prefecture. Daoist Master Gu has gone to the west, so the one here must be Daoist Master Yu... He is a Purple Qi cultivator possessing a technique called 'Omen of the Dao's Origin', which is extremely formidable. You must be absolutely careful!"

Liu Changdie manipulated his Spiritual Treasure to break the array while laughing.

"So it is a Purple Qi cultivator... how formidable can he be? I have Purple Qi cultivators in Jiangnan as well. This path is skilled in the hundred arts, but they are not made for combat. This type of Dao lineage... if someone stands in front to protect them, allowing them to cast spells steadily, they pose some threat... otherwise..."

Liu Changdie's Dao-Profundity was not high, but he possessed vision and knew many Dao secrets. Although he had never seen a Purple Qi Great Daoist Master, he had interacted with many cultivators of this path and naturally judged them accurately. However, Wu Miao shook his head and said with a rather mysterious air,

"Fellow Daoist, there is something you do not know... Although all Purple Qi originates from the True Dao Sect, there are several factions. The most famous is the Purple Emblem Palace, but in reality, there is also a lineage from the Chancellor Liang's Terrace that cultivates the Three Yins alongside Purple Qi and Cold Qi. The former gathers a multitude of Daoists, while the latter focuses on refined cultivation. This Lord Yu belongs to the Liang Xiang faction. The 'Omen of the Dao's Origin' is unique to that path and is particularly distinctive; it must be cultivated from Pure Qi..."

Li Zhouwei did not underestimate the enemy and asked for details. When it came to these fringe rumors, Qiao Wenliu was actually less informed than Wu Miao. The old man added with colorful embellishment,

"I have heard that the Yu family possesses a True Scripture handed down from the ancient Chancellor Liang's Terrace. It has been ritually refined by every generation, and inside, they have cultivated four Qi Spirits. Although its power has greatly diminished today, once the 'Omen of the Dao's Origin' is mastered, wielding this True Scripture treasure makes one especially formidable."

"Daoist Master Yu reads scriptures in his grotto-heaven every day and was originally known for being unskilled in combat. Later, he stepped past the Purple Mystery, obtained the 'Omen of the Dao's Origin' and the True Scripture, and leapt to the upper-middle tier. Ordinary people, even if they swarmed him together, would not be able to defeat him!"

Li Zhouwei looked thoughtful, a strange expression appearing in his eyes, but he asked no further questions and simply pondered.

He had advanced with light equipment, leading his men across various lands, raiding all the way from the Chefu to High-Peak City, and had surrounded this array for a full four hours.

That Great Daoist Master inside, Yu Xixin, was indeed famous for his caution. He did not even show his head, allowing the bombardment from outside to rage on while he merely used his great divine ability to link with the array, defending without coming out.

This countermeasure did not seek a long defense, only to avoid an early loss. Although mediocre, it was indeed error-free. Li Zhouwei could roughly calculate the other party's thoughts.

'High-Peak City is a fortress of the Central Plains. Emperor Zhao fell here in the past, nurturing astonishing spiritual vitality and fertile soil. The great formation here definitely ranks in the top three of the entire Gu Prefecture... As long as he defends the city, whether the Northern Yan cultivators come or reinforcements arrive from the rear... it will not be difficult...'

Although Bian Fan had cut off the Great Void, the cultivators of Gu Prefecture could still enter and exit through Chun City in the center, leading directly to High-Peak City. It was just that Li Zhouwei had besieged High-Peak City, and without a Great Daoist Master to lead them, those people dared not come to support.

'The only one I need to be wary of... is Longkang Yao...'

That person was wounded, not fallen. Although Li Zhouwei knew through the 'Spirit Probe' that he had gone south, likely hiding back in the south to heal, there was no guarantee that this person would not secretly come to aid. Every minute and second of time was extremely precious.

Once Longkang Yao arrived to reinforce, Yu Xixin inside would immediately come out to join the encirclement. While Li Zhouwei could advance or retreat freely, the men beside him would likely have to scatter and flee, looking for another turning point.

Therefore, during these four hours, the Stormshatter Wedges were operated to their limit. This array-breaking supreme treasure from Azure Pond displayed magnificent brilliance. As King Wei, he went all out, holding the *Illustrious-Yang King's Battle Axe*, and relying on his vast divine ability and dharma power, he hacked down a full sixty-eight times!

As for the others, they used spiritual fire to burn or Lesser Yin to suppress, resorting to every conceivable means. Qiao Wenliu even entered the fray personally, holding that radiant *Azure Niche*, and smashed it down with a boom!

"Boom!"

The *Azure Niche* grew like the wind, transmitting an astonishing suction force. The burning flames on the great formation were like prey meeting a natural predator; their brilliance dimmed in an instant as they were stripped away layer by layer, all flowing into the niche.

The great formation here was formed from Virile Fire. While not particularly formidable in itself, the earth veins and spiritual vitality were simply too terrifying, and with a Great Daoist Master supporting it from within, it had leapt to become a critical vital point. With Lesser Yin suppressing it like this, a large swathe of fierce flames could be stripped from the top every time, and the effect was surprisingly good.

Finally, amidst the flickering of the great formation, a soft sigh resounded through the sky.

"Fellow Daoist... why must you be so aggressive!"

In an instant, bright colors lit up from within the great formation, gathering into brilliant purple clouds. Ethereal as smoke, they overturned the suppressing *Azure Niche* and condensed into a field of purple.

A middle-aged man stood amidst the purple clouds, his eyes filled with helplessness.

This person was of medium build, with hair and beard half-white. His long beard fluttered, and on his handsome and elegant face, his eyes appeared slightly narrow. His aged hands clasped a scroll of scriptures. Standing in the sky, he blocked the surging Merging Fire and the brilliant Heavenly Light all at once!

Yu Xixin.

The great formation was about to break, and reinforcements had not arrived; this Great Daoist Master of the Yu clan finally had no choice but to show himself!

Thus, he raised his hand and inverted the scripture scroll, looking like an unremarkable Daoist from the mountains. There was no brilliant divine ability, nor any accompanying water or fire; he simply tapped lightly against that *Azure Niche*.

'Cultivation of the Earth and the Stars'!

Purple Qi surged, and the sound of scriptures rang out loudly.

This Daoist Master Yu was impressively a 'Purple Qi' Great Daoist Master!

Qiao Wenliu's figure stiffened abruptly. The *Azure Niche*, which had been displaying great divine might in the sky, deflated like a leaking ball. Its brilliance and size shrank dramatically, beaten back to its original form in an instant, fixed in the air by a smear of purple, unable to move.

The sky-filling Purple Qi acted like layer upon layer of barriers, restricting all the light and color in the sky. This Great Daoist Master flipped his hand and pressed his fingers together, immediately pointing towards Daoist Master Qiao's brow!

But what greeted him was darkness shrouding heaven and earth. A massive setting sun crouched before his eyes, and a glint of gold flickered within the Daoist's pupils as a strong surge of Bright Yang color came rushing forth!

*Pure Yang Bracelets*.

This Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure came and went like the wind, like a light cavalryman, turning and killing its way to the front of the Great Daoist Master. Yu Xixin, however, raised his hand and took a step forward. His figure became void and illusory, and he actually passed right through the golden bracelet!

'Principal of Nurturing Life'.

But what poured down was not just Bright Yang; densely packed rays of Lesser Yin light, like venomous snakes, also wrapped around his arm, locking onto his wrist. This greatly reduced his momentum, and even with the protection of his Body Divine Ability, the power of this finger strike was significantly weakened before it landed on Qiao Wenliu's brow.

Unexpectedly, this Daoist Master Qiao's 'Taichong Observation' did not activate. He forcefully took this blow, and like one waking from a great dream, he staggered back three steps. He neither circulated his Spiritual Treasure nor manipulated his divine ability, but stood dazed in place.

Yu Xixin had no time to pursue his victory. The sense of danger behind him grew thicker and thicker. He could only abandon Qiao Wenliu in front of him, turn around, and raise his hand. Sure enough, a bright and crystalline halberd tip was already before him!

It was a streak of the utmost brilliant gold.

Li Zhouwei!

The pervasive Purple Qi imprisoned the various divine abilities, yet it could not make this King Wei waver in the slightest. He approached from afar, weaving through the Purple Qi. The intent of suppression came constantly, causing the radiance on his body to grow more intense with each pulse. Empowered by 'Sovereign Treading Peril', he lunged forward like a terrifying comet!

Yu Xixin did not seem surprised. A trace of helplessness flashed in the depths of his eyes. His figure became void and illusory as he sidestepped with lightning speed. Pressing three fingers together, he tapped against the halberd shaft as they passed each other, lifting it gently. Taking another step, he was already behind Li Zhouwei.

But the sound of a long sword unsheathing resounded. The sky turned desolate, and blood fell like rain. All the Purple Qi was shattered with a bang, and what greeted him was this King Wei abruptly turning around, delivering a punch filled with abundant power!

Yu Xixin's brows furrowed tightly. A moment of hesitation appeared in his eyes, and in the end, he dared not receive it. Instead, he flipped his hand and erected a palm in front of him. A bright light barrier instantly emerged, appearing like profound unity purple, enveloping him.

_Clang!_

A melodious sound emerged, followed closely by the sizzling sound of Merging Fire. The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was like vicious insects and snakes, constantly leaping and devouring upon that purple light. Yu Xixin's expression changed slightly, and he abruptly retreated a step.

His 'Principal of Nurturing Life' controlled the domain of Purple Qi to dissipate like smoke on its own, and purple intent suddenly was born beneath his feet as he opened up the distance immediately—but dissipating at the same time was the infinite darkness in the sky. This King Wei was almost synchronized with him, stepping out closely against him, a fist shining with Heavenly Light instantly enlarging before his eyes!

_Thud!_

The purple spirit barrier shook, and the loud sound rang out in the sky once more. Yu Xixin was passive to the extreme, closing his eyes tightly in frustration.

'If I had known it would come to this! Yet I have no choice but to fight him!'

He let out a long sigh, and the scripture scroll he had been gripping tightly finally unfurled.

Countless golden characters were seen on the brown wooden slips. The moment they unfurled, they gushed out like a waterfall, gathering and condensing in the air, transforming into various halos of light. Daoist Master Yu's face was solemn, his mouth holding the constitution of heaven as he uttered a sound:

"From the One Qi, the division begins; manifesting in likeness and form. I align with Heaven and Earth, merging with their spontaneous division!"

Divine Ability—'Omen of the Dao's Origin'!

The golden characters immediately congealed in the air, gathering in the four directions. They actually transformed into four majestic and imposing statues. The one in the North wore a robe of Daoist scriptures, his face dignified, three eyes glaring in anger, holding heavy silver incense ash, with thunder condensed and undissipating. The one in the East appeared as a woman amidst elk and birds, holding a osmanthus branch and smashing it down gently.

The one in the South burned incense like rosy clouds, fire bells chiming, incense ash spiraling like sparks, spewing out blazing and inexhaustible True Fire. The one in the West gathered essence and energy, white smoke flickering in and out of existence, with long silk stretching continuously yet hard as metal and iron, binding towards his entire body!

In that instant, Li Zhouwei felt the spirituality of these four immortal images; each one was actually like a living person. His golden pupils flowed over the weapons in their hands, adding a touch of amusement.

'Truly a deep foundation. These Qi Spirits... are already unusual, and the items in their hands are each Spiritual Artifacts... No wonder they have such prestige!'

His hands and feet were locked by the long silk, his figure suppressed by the osmanthus branch, fire burned and roasted his front and back, and the incense ash condensing thunder was scattered upon his body. Each one possessed astonishing power. These four figures cast huge shadows in heaven and earth, filled with killing intent. In an instant, offense and defense shifted, suppressing him within.

Only at this moment did Qiao Wenliu on the other side come back to his senses. Slightly startled in his heart, he raised his brows and glanced over, secretly fearful.

'Daoist Master Yu... his divine ability has improved again!'

He wanted to rush to support, but was blocked by a cultivator riding the wind in the center. This person looked young, cultivated Converging Water, and resolutely blocked his path, causing Qiao Wenliu to frown.

Intense Purple Qi instantly shrouded the sky!

Li Zhouwei was successfully suppressed, and Yu Xixin finally could free his hands and feet. Although he still kept his palms pressed together hanging in the sky, using all his divine ability and dharma power to maintain the scriptures, his divine abilities could respond as usual.

'Cultivation of the Earth and the Stars'.

Seeing that Li Zhouwei had failed to escape, this Daoist Master Yu finally had time to let out a breath, the tight string in his heart relaxing.

'Good! Next is the moment for me to cast spells at will!'

In an instant, purple-gold light emerged on his face. Relying on his extremely deep Dao-Profundity, while holding the scripture, two hands formed of Purple Qi immediately emerged behind him, forming seals to cast spells. Two purple lips and teeth also split open on his cheeks, chanting the dense sound of scriptures.

Indeed, he, a Purple Qi cultivator, was not skilled in combat. But as a cultivator of Chun City, Yu Xixin had spent countless days and nights refining unknown numbers of Dharma Arts tailored to his own divine abilities and Dao lineage, precisely for this moment!

In the sky, scalding incense ash leaped, and fire and thunder flowed over King Wei's body, bursting forth with patches of dangerous halos. Even though his Dharma Body was astonishing, patches of scorched black appeared under the suppression of these four Great Qi Spirits, and he was bound by that extremely formidable long silk, unable to move for a time.

The distant Great Daoist Master had already risen with the momentum, his immortal might infinite. But in Li Zhouwei's eyes, not only was there not a trace of shock, but a hint of strangeness also emerged.

These Qi Spirits...

This King Wei raised his hand little by little, looking at the increasingly bright golden patterns on his palm. Allowing these bright patterns to crawl up his face, feeling the abundant divine ability and dharma power echoing endlessly within his body, he gently exhaled.

'Moving with a thought, almost comparable to a cultivator...'

The encirclement of 'Sovereign Treading Peril' is complete!

*White Qilin* life-mandate resonance!

Those eyes became extremely bright in an instant. He almost ignored the rolling Purple Qi pouring down from the sky, gently flipping his hand to grasp the long silk in his palm. Stimulating his divine ability to the limit, he pulled with all his might!

In the sky, that Qi Spirit amidst flickering white smoke and continuous long silk was originally majestic, holding the silk with both hands. But suddenly, it staggered. Before the abundant force, it wavered instead, crashing down from the clouds with a boom, falling rapidly towards the White Qilin.

_Boom!_

This Qi Spirit crashed to the ground with a loud noise, and what greeted it was a fast and ruthless stomp.

_Thud!_

Heavenly Light shot up into the sky. This foot trampled straight into that statue-like chest. Web-like cracks instantly spread everywhere. Those strips of continuous long silk shattered into pieces in the Heavenly Light, turning back into their original forms and drifting down.

"Cough, cough..."

In the distance, Yu Xixin reacted immediately. The lips and arms gathered from Purple Qi all congealed, and all Dharma Arts stagnated in this instant.

The sky turned desolate, blood fell like rain.

Before the Qi Spirit in the sky that appeared like a woman holding a osmanthus branch could raise her Spiritual Artifact, bright 'Searing Light' emerged immediately, like a firework exploding in the sky, bursting abruptly on her face.

_Boom!_

A trembling sound emerged in heaven and earth.

Yu Xixin's barely opened eyes were filled with shock. Heavy layers of thunder light bound his body, and a thick, undissolving gold was reflected in them. What emerged in those pupils that had read scriptures for years was layer upon layer of palace gates, constantly unfolding.

'Imperial Observation of the Origin'.

In that instant, everything on the earth moved away from him. In the vast darkness, there were only those layer upon layer of opening palace towers. 'Principal of Nurturing Life' caused his body to constantly shift between reality and illusion, but he was bound by the Searing Light. This divine ability did not possess the conceptual-aspect of escaping, so no matter what, he could not stop that bright light and color from getting closer and closer to him.

_Thud!_

Infinite halls unfolded before him. Yu Xixin relied on the Purple Qi to take a step, but without warning, a Heavenly Gate brilliant as white jade appeared out of thin air. The bright corner of the gate had already smashed into him. This Great Daoist Master could only circulate his divine ability and forcefully unfurl the scripture in his hand.

_Boom!_

Four Qi Spirits emerged around him, propping up this Heavenly Gate together, blocking the blazing Heavenly Light and the inexhaustible purple flames. Yet Yu Xixin had not a trace of a smile; only thick vigilance remained in his pupils.

Sure enough, from within those raging purple flames, a black-robed man had already stepped out. That profound sword, seemingly stained with golden blood, was held in his hand, slowly returning to its sheath.

Unknown when it happened, Yu Xixin also held a Dharma sword in his hand, entirely pure purple with flowing golden light. He concentrated his spirit and breath, standing quietly just like that. The Dharma sword in his hand was also raised, shining forth continuous Purple Qi that rushed away with a boom.

King Wei faced the Purple Qi and stepped forward.

But unepectedly, this King Wei did not close in. Instead, he rushed towards the Qi Spirit of flickering white smoke and continuous long silk, whose body of cracks was recovering at an extremely fast speed.

Yu Xixin frowned slowly, puzzled in his heart.

As a Great Daoist Master, his, Yu Xixin's, entire set of divine abilities and spell arts were highly compatible. The 'Omen of the Dao's Origin' assisted the Qi Spirits, allowing them to gather and disperse, while 'Principal of Nurturing Life' protected the life-mandate, and simultaneously protected these Qi Spirits...

Li Zhouwei's stomp should have exploded this Qi Spirit. But the Omen of the Dao's Origin preserved the Qi Spirit's foundation, and Principal of Nurturing Life protected its life-mandate. As long as his, Yu Xixin's, two divine abilities were undamaged, the Qi Spirits would not be shaken at their root; even if beaten to destruction, they would recover extremely quickly...

'Since he is a Great Daoist Master, how could he not see this clearly!'

This doubt flashed through his mind. Abundant Purple Qi whistled out but was suppressed by Imperial Observation of the Origin and could not break Sovereign Treading Peril, only making clinking sounds on King Wei's Dharma Body. But Li Zhouwei had already gracefully passed through the Purple Qi and closed in, arriving beneath that colossal Qi Spirit.

He did not circulate a divine ability, nor did he cast a spell art. He merely gripped the long sword and unsheathed it abruptly—the blade was mottled with bloodstains.

"Thud!"

Heavenly Scenery circulated, and all changes congealed in this instant. But what emerged by this Great Daoist Master's ear was a subtle sound like hot charcoal falling onto ice and snow.

_Sizzle..._

In the sky, the Qi Spirit's injuries were not yet healed. At this moment, its entire left arm was like melting ice and snow, smashing crookedly onto the ground. This Qi Spirit of flickering white smoke and continuous long silk was like tattered cotton, collapsing with a boom, utterly destroyed!

Sword of King Jing of Wei.

Exterminating spirits and ghosts—Purifying Profundity.

This top-tier Spiritual Treasure of ancient Wei was famous for exterminating ghosts and spirits, and had gathered dust for many years... In today's world, the arts of spirits and ghosts had greatly diminished, but this kind of spirit-exterminating Spiritual Treasure had not weakened. With the empowerment of Imperial Observation of the Origin and the White Qilin's life-mandate urging it, under the shift of power, how terrifying was the exterminating might of this sword!

"Pfft!"

Yu Xixin's expression changed drastically. That face instantly turned pale, and he violently spurred out a mouthful of fresh blood. He felt the world spin and his vision blur, understanding instantly in his heart:

'Spirits and ghosts extermination art...'

A chill went from his head to his feet instantly. But before he could react, he saw King Wei raising the long sword once again.

'Not good!'

This sword scared him out of his wits. Without hesitation, this Purple Qi Great Daoist Master sucked in a breath of cold air. The words in his mouth were even faster than his movements as he exclaimed in shock,

"King Wei, wait! Do not harm my foundation of several generations!"

"Oh?"

The White Qilin turned his head, staring at him with golden eyes that held a smile.

For a moment, the burning purple flames stopped dancing, and the long-dormant incense ash and thunder also congealed in mid-air. It was as if all divine abilities stopped operating at this moment, leaving only a suffocating silence.

Yu Xixin was stunned. A trace of hesitation flashed in his eyes, but it did not last long. In the end, he suppressed the pain filling his heart, sighed, and said,

"I, Yu, admit my guilt..."

The black-robed youth before him sheathed his sword, a trace of delight flashing in his eyes. His five fingers tightened on the hilt of the sword as he raised his brows and said,

"Of the two Daos of the True Purple, the Yang governs the external, and the Yin cultivates the internal. Purple Qi values virtue and is not a path of war. The Great Daoist Master was loyal to his duty and went all out; what guilt is there?"

The Qi Spirits in the sky drifted away like clouds and smoke. Yu Xixin rolled up the scripture scroll, catching a glimpse of cracks in the corner. His heart ached extremely, and his mouth was full of bitterness.

To be honest, after this battle, Yu Xixin was already numb—his spell arts could barely touch this King Wei. *Cultivation of the Earth and the Stars* and *Principal of Nurturing Life* were dead suppressed by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead and Sovereign Treading Peril. The remaining *Chapter on Arranging Purple* was not his path's specialty. In his hands, it was focused on increasing his Dao-Profundity and could not be used in a battle at the level of a Great Daoist Master!

To put it bluntly, from the moment Li Zhouwei dragged down the Qi Spirit and broke the encirclement, he, Yu Xixin, a dignified Great Daoist Master, had no solution other than stalling...

And how could he, Yu Xixin, dare to persist within Imperial Observation of the Origin and wait for southern reinforcements? He was relying on the fact that the *Scripture of Four Qi Facing Purple* in his hand still possessed numerous powers. Bluntly speaking, most of his divine abilities and spell arts were closely related to it...

Leaving aside how long he could last in the White Qilin's hands, the other cultivators asked him to defend, so he naturally did his best. But fighting and killing was a small matter; if the *Scripture of Four Qi Facing Purple* was damaged, that would be touching his lifeblood!

The Heavenly Light around him was slowly fading, revealing the scene of the sky filled with Merging Fire. Seeing King Wei's amused gaze, this Purple Qi Great Daoist Master could only give a bitter smile, lowering his brow as he said,

"I only ask King Wei... to treat the Qi clan well!"

"Do not worry. This King does not abolish public duty for private reasons."

Li Zhouwei's voice echoed in the sky. This Great Daoist Master's last shred of worry was laid to rest. In full view of everyone, above the Purple Mansion Spirit formation, he bowed down to the ground. Touching the scripture in his bosom, still feeling the heartache, he sighed.

"Please let me be the vanguard for King Wei!"
