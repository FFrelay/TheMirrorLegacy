# Winter Solstice Extra: Molding Profundity

Heavy snow blanketed the mountains under the bright, clear moonlight.

In the mountain forest, the wind and snow were biting, pressing the tree branches into deep bows. The white snow on the path was piled layer upon layer, exceedingly thick. Yet, a figure was seen treading through the snow, slightly small of stature, dressed in thin grey clothes with a sword slung at their waist. Their movements were like that of a wandering swordsman, strikingly bold.

This person walked all the way into the mountains. As if the wind and snow had grown too heavy, she raised a hand, reached behind her, and bound her flowing black hair, revealing a smooth profile. She sighed, a touch of boredom in her voice.

"Ever since those Woven Jades from Supreme Enclosure began manipulating the Cold Qi, the winter nights have grown colder by the day… Everything is frozen solid, which makes it all so dull…"

Her crisp voice echoed in the night. Following a step behind her was another person, a youth, who was quite composed. Just as he was about to speak, laughter drifted from the forest.

"Disciple-sister, you're wrong about that."

The woman lifted her head to see a person descending from the summit to meet them, wrapped in a white fur robe and covered in flurries of snow. A circle of white light shone behind his head like a halo, giving him the appearance of an immortal. His handsome eyes fixed on her as he smiled and said,

"Several fellow Daoists have said it is a matter of merit. Although the High Firmament grant no boons, there is also no sin or punishment. Even Yu Zhuan hasn't said a thing!"

Upon seeing this man, the youth hurriedly bowed. "Greetings, True Monarch!"

The woman was exceedingly dashing. Having bound her hair, she rested her hand on her sword and gave a cold sneer.

"I don't care—that's only because the mortal realm is prosperous, and every household has charcoal to burn. Otherwise, you'll see… see if Yu Zhuan still doesn't find fault!"

Her disciple-brother instantly fell silent, shaking his head with a helpless laugh. The youth bowed his head even lower in silence. The True Monarch above fixed his gaze upon them, and the wind and snow seemed to quiet down. He looked at the youth and spoke softly.

"You must be Yu Wendao. This venerable one has heard Changtang mention you."

The youth kowtowed, but the woman was relentless.

"You don't believe me, disciple-brother? Or is it that… it has nothing to do with having charcoal to burn, but that Dongjun no longer manifests and the Supreme Yang Palace is without a master, so those rules need not be so strict? Otherwise, with a single snowfall, how many people would freeze to death? It would be best to abolish the Dao of 'Cold Qi' altogether."

Her words cast both of them in a bad light, leaving them with no response. Her disciple-brother sighed, and while pulling her up the path, he seemed to recall something and laughed.

"It's always been you who mocks others, but lately I heard a phrase from the Heavenly Gate: 'Loutai verified late, losing the Dao Fruit.' So it seems you've been mocked by others as well."

The woman was unconcerned, only saying, "That's obvious. It must have been spread by Wuguan and his group. That fellow has always enjoyed criticizing current affairs. Let them talk. Just because one is a noble True Monarch, does one have to control all the mouths in the world? I'm not Huan Xuan, to be so petty."

The man laughed in spite of himself and led her up the mountain. In front of the temple, a middle-aged man was sweeping snow. Seeing the two descend, he quickly bowed and was about to speak, but the man waved him away.

"Yi Chuan, go inside and tell your disciple-brother that True Monarch Shuolou of the Profound Moon has arrived, and have him heat the wine."

The middle-aged man appeared extremely excited and hurried inside. The disciple-brother said, 

"Back then, Eldest Disciple-Brother caught a Heavenly Wolf. I took the blood from that beast to brew wine. On a day like this, it's perfect to take it out and warm ourselves."

"Having wine to drink is always a good thing."

She laughed heartily, but then glanced inside and shook her head.

"So that's Xiao Dongyan… I see… he's not material for cultivation. Disciple-brother… you are just like me. Look at the kind of people Azure Profundity recruits, yet you and I… we get either mediocrities or old men. Who will inherit our Daoist tradition?"

The immortal-like figure blinked, withdrew his hand, his voice indifferent.

"If I find them pleasing to the eye, I will accept them even if they have no Dao-comprehension. If I find them displeasing, then even the likes of Qin and Tang are useless to me."

He then said, "Wendao, you wait here."

The two strode inside, heading straight for the main hall. Above them hung a plaque with three large characters inscribed upon it:

【Molding Profundity Temple】.

Inside, in the great hall with a bluestone floor, hung a reverential portrait. It depicted a person with a tall, straight posture, dressed in navy blue robes, facing a bluestone wall. Only a side profile was visible, the hand behind his back holding a sword.

Upon reaching this place, the man's expression had become completely solemn, and even the woman grew serious. Together, they held incense and offered it before the portrait, then retreated with light steps. The young cultivator was still kneeling before the hall when he heard the woman's ethereal voice.

"Disciple-brother Wei… it has been many years since we've seen Master… I wonder how he is."

Beside her, the immortal-like figure clasped his hands behind his back, gazing leisurely at the snow-filled sky as he smiled.

"I think there's no need to dwell on it. When that person went away back then, Master was full of concern. Figures like them, having left their Dao behind, will naturally venture beyond the heavens to question the infinite unknown. How could they bow their heads and fold their wings to serve in this cage?"

"Well said!"

Before the woman could answer, a cry of admiration was already heard from the distant horizon.

Then, the boundless snow condensed in the sky. Azure-gold light formed like clouds, from which endless green sprouts emerged. Distant yellow steps meandered among the myriad mountains. The sound of the Dao was profound, and all the immortals looked up in reverence!

『Lesser Yang』 instantly manifested.

Amidst the myriad streams of clear light, Yu Wendao prostrated on the ground, his heart pounding.

Who else could it be?

The contemporary Lesser Yang, known as the 'Profound Monarch of Lesser Yang Who Molds the Dao of Seven Virtues' and the 'True Monarch of Lesser Yang of the Cardinal Palace'!

'He has come out of seclusion.'

The youth lost his composure and bowed.

"Greetings to the 【Primal True Divine Ferrying Immortal Lord of Lesser Yang】!"

Only then did he hear the True Monarch beside him look up in pleasant surprise.

"Eldest Disciple-Brother!"

The figure in the sky stepped forward. Where his foot landed, a golden bridge appeared. The light of Lesser Yang, fine as silk threads, rippled out like water, condensing on both sides of the bridge into gleaming golden palaces. Celestial maidens sang and danced, and the Profound Palace chanted the Dao, as if heaven and earth were meant to be this way, merely wiped clean of their obscuring dust.

He stepped onto the snowy ground, and the bluestone platform on the mountaintop was instantly surrounded by golden palaces of deep, rich colors. The sound of zithers played across the sky as celestial attendants emerged in sequence. The woman laughed and said, "To think we actually disturbed Disciple-brother's seclusion!"

Yu Wendao looked up to find that the newcomer was dressed in black, without any unusual adornments, and the space behind him was empty. He was just like a mortal!

'He is the First Lesser Yang!'

But when he lowered his head, he found he could not recall His appearance. Recalling it carefully, he only felt the face was a blur, yet behind Him were seven rings of light, intricately overlapping, interwoven with azure and gold. He must be a supreme and exalted god.

'As expected… A being like Him cannot be perceived by divine ability or the naked eye. To look upon Him, one feels He is an ordinary mortal thing. To contemplate Him internally, there is supreme radiance, like visualizing the very origin of 『Lesser Yang』!'

His heart trembled with awe, yet he heard Him say casually, "This seclusion was truly too long. If I hadn't appeared again, I'm afraid you all would be wondering if this venerable one was already beyond the heavens."

Only faint laughter reached his ears. The Exalted Immortal paused, then said, "Why is Guangling not here?"

Guanhua said unhurriedly, "A few days ago… Guangling fought a battle with Han Zhe. Within the heavens, everything is suppressed, so the fight was unsatisfying. They fought all the way out beyond the heavens, revealing ten-thousand-zhang Dharma Bodies. He finally managed to get the upper hand on Han Zhe and gained great enlightenment. He is currently sleeping in the Earth Abyss and has not yet awoken."

"Then there's no need to wake him. It is enough that the three of us are here."

But the woman said in a peculiar tone, "If you're going to fight, fight within the heavens. Running all the way out beyond the heavens, revealing a Dharma Body, learning to fight like those Demon beasts… their life-mandates are matched to their Fruition Attainment, and they look more like demons than people. The Master of Encompassing Profundity mentioned he disliked it back then, and I don't think it looks good either…"

The Lesser Yang shook his head and said, "Going outside has its advantages. Guangling cultivates Wu Earth, which is a good Dao lineage. It is honored as the center of the Five Virtues and revered as the master of Earth Virtue. He can comprehend it better in the outer world."

Then there were sounds of warmed wine and merriment, of goblets being exchanged. He finally lowered his head, and a warm gaze fell upon the young man as He asked, "Someone from the Yu Clan?"

"Yes.", the woman's voice said. "He is currently cultivating by my side. The Azure Profundity are still more likable, and since he is young and lacks the habit of debating morality to get ahead, I allowed him to cultivate with me."

That Exalted Immortal did not need to perform a divination; seeing him, He saw through his life-mandate and his name.

He smiled and said, "Yu Wendao… today is the Winter Solstice. Why have you not returned to Green Pine Temple?"

The young cultivator laughed. "I was supposed to go. I heard that many years ago, all the disciples would also gather at the temple, but during the incense offering… they looked closely, and the Great One was just sitting on the altar with a cloak on, picking up the spirit fruits and eating them. Our Master was overcome with excitement, and afterwards… we all changed to gathering… at the foot of the mountain. Only a few True Monarchs go to the temple now."

There was light laughter from both sides. The Exalted Immortal said, "That's nothing! During the Great Sage's celebration, that Great One even went so far as to disguise himself as a demon and run into the sea, bossing around the little demons inside. He scared the Great Sage Jinghai half to death."

Guanhua laughed. "It was indeed frightening. Dongfang Jing is majestic, but she's only at the level of a disciple from our [Overlooking Gaze Perceiving the Profound]. Not to mention Dharma Treasures, even in a bare-fisted fight, she might not be a match for Qingyi, let alone the Profound Master… and that one places the utmost importance on mortal lives. What lies beneath the Demon beasts of the Eastern Sea is not clean!"

The Exalted Immortal tapped his cup thoughtfully and turned his head. "Your Great One is most benevolent. It's no wonder you of Azure Profundity do not contend for power and are well-liked, it's just that you have few disciples."

The young cultivator agreed meekly, not daring to comment. The Exalted Immortal then stood up and smiled. "Back then, when I was still young, I followed my Master to visit Green Pine. We traveled all the way to the temple and met the Great One. He looked at me and praised me, saying, 'What a grand inheritance for your descendants!' Then he took my hand and said, 'Yuan Shou, I have performed a divination for you. Your good disciple will have the surname Qu and will be in the East.'"

This Exalted Immortal filled his cup, somewhat moved. "And just as predicted, that boy Qu Da was born in the East, and has now ascended to a Surplus Position of Lesser Yang, which shows his capability. As for the Wang Clan… they are still not prosperous. 'A grand inheritance for your descendants'… this venerable one has yet to see it."

Shuolou's voice was light and airy. "I have also heard that the Great One is skilled at divination."

"Speaking of skilled divination… one must mention Qingyi, but She is different from the Great One."

This Exalted Immortal smiled. "Qingyi uses 【Derivation】. It deduces future outcomes from the present, making it precise and accurate, but it cannot see far. If the present changes today, the future will surely have variables. It is the art of calculating heaven and earth with one's own self. But the Great One is, after all, the Master of Azure Profundity, and uses 【Prophecy】. This is far more brilliant. It is the method of making heaven and earth conform to one's self. It may not be precise, but it is like a gentle spring breeze transforming into rain, proving itself in the final details."

The three of them drank a measure together. This Exalted Immortal quietly turned, looked at the young cultivator beside him, and smiled.

"Now… how about I perform a divination for you as well?"

The young cultivator quickly knelt. Before he could even express his thanks, the immortal before him had already begun the finger gestures. The dim yellow and azure radiance flickered again, as if he were immersed in all kinds of profound light.

He then heard the Exalted Immortal laugh and say, "You… are one with great opportunities. No wonder you were able to stand out. In the future, you may have the good fortune to ascend to a position. Go to the South, establish a Daoist tradition, and pacify the various tribes. You will surely be a cultivator of renown."

The cultivator thanked him profusely, his face full of joy. After the young man was sent away, He then said softly, "I heard… that the Night Marquis has established a Daoist tradition and intends to manage the affairs of the Underworld?"

Guanhua said in a low voice, "That is correct. He established a Daoist tradition called 【Awaiting Clarity】 and founded a sect, calling himself the Governor of Souls, wishing to manage the affairs of the departed spirits. He says he will gather all the souls and ghosts of the world and open up a special domain for them."

The woman's voice immediately became helpless. "There is already a Nether Land, and now he wants to open another one called the Underworld. They already govern the heavens and the people, and now they want to govern the dead as well. Aren't they overstepping their bounds… Nowadays, countless rogue cultivators dare to claim that one profundity surpasses the heavens. When these words spread to the northern mountains, there are actually people who agree."

"Guangling mentioned it at the time. The rise of Encompassing Profundity is certainly due to the ```divine way's timing```, but the Three Profoundities are under one roof. How could the other two Daos be inferior? It is just that our Dao seeks self-veneration and supreme nobility, while Azure Profundity's heart lies in the Three-in-One. Thus, the mortal order was left for them to establish, leading unexpectedly to this day."

The Exalted Immortal seemed quite emotional and shook his head. "Harmonizing the world is not an easy burden to bear. The world is now at peace, so there is no need to take some casual rumors to heart."

He filled the cups for his two junior disciples and said softly, "Back then, Master traveled the world and passed down six scrolls. He brought the two of you back from the mortal world and appointed me to teach you. You each asked a question then. Do you still remember?"

The two True Monarchs were rather uneasy and nodded. He said, "Wei Yi asked: 'The Profound Heaven's High Firmament, upon what does it rely? Since it is a constant thing, why does it have likes and dislikes?' Wushang asked: 'The vastness beyond the heavens, its measure unknown; in its deep and endless darkness, who knows the reason for it?'"

"One asked of the Heavenly Dao, the other of the world beyond. At that time, I could not answer…"

The Exalted Immortal raised his head and said quietly, "Now, my own path is about to reach its end. I have an answer for Wei Yi's question. Only Wu Shang's question remains, which I still cannot answer."

The music filling the sky stopped, and the flying snow froze in mid-air. Neither of the junior disciples spoke. There was only the sound of the woman lightly tapping her cup.

"No wonder Disciple-brother made a special trip this year."

She laughed. "If I had known, I would not have asked."

The immortal in black took a step forward and ruffled her hair, his tone holding not a hint of hesitation.

"Back then… this was also a question I once asked Master. He did not answer me either. And this answer… is something one can only go see for oneself."

When his words ended, only the sound of whistling snow remained in the mountains. After a long while, the Exalted Immortal's voice was heard again.

"Under the Clear Yi Enclosure are all Exalted Immortals without selfish desires. Huan Xuan has a worse temper, but he is pure and proud. There is no need to worry much. If you are concerned about the Dao lineage… I see that people like Tianxiang, Qu Da, and Longkang are all capable of shouldering great responsibilities. Focus on spreading the Immortal Dao, and all will surely become clear."

"Yes!"

A light voice echoed through the mountains. The Exalted Immortal had already stepped forward, standing with his hands behind his back, and said with a laugh, "The Heavenly Dao is impermanent; rise and fall have no cause. Go and seek the Great Dao for yourselves!"
