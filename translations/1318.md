# Chapter 1318: Distant Mountains

The sky gradually darkened.

Above Juan City, radiance rippled and undulated. A brilliant light was racing swiftly from the north, soon stopping before the grand formation. It tentatively transmitted a message through divine ability, then began waiting before the great array.

Yehui's mental abacus clattered like thunder.

'This Sima Yuanli has always been adept at currying favor with all sides. His storage pouch is stuffed with treasures piled as high as mountains, yet he never takes out even one or two to share. He's learned the art of protecting himself wisely. But today when I probed him with words, he seemed quite resolute...'

Yehui's parting jab at Sima Yuanli before departure was not without reason. Though the Sima family had fallen into decline, they had once been loyal subjects of True Martial. If the Yang family and that Song Emperor wished to accomplish anything, logically speaking, they wouldn't allow this man to perish.

'Since he's leading from the front and dares to follow King Wei northward, there must be support from Song Emperor and the Yang family...'

He, Bai Ziyu, wasn't questioning King Wei's capabilities, but one who can attack may not necessarily defend. Once a retreat begins without the protection of Exiled Qi, the situation would become unmanageable. If the Yang family was providing support, Yehui could operate with more freedom.

'Counting the days, that pill should be ready soon. Once this battle is finished and I've gained some merit, I can return to secluded cultivation and cross into Purple Mystery.'

He waited for a short while before someone finally emerged from the formation, riding divine ability with what appeared to be some haste. Upon seeing Yehui, his mouth split into a wide smile as he called out,

"Bai Ziyu!"

Yehui cupped his hands with a laugh,

"So it's Daoist Sanyi."

These two had known each other for some time, their relationship that of rivals and friends alike. Yehui, having finally caught him in a moment of decline, couldn't resist a few taunts. He stepped forward two paces and said with barbed humor,

"Oh my, Daoist Qiao has also surrendered!"

Seeing the direction from which he'd come, Qiao Wenliu had already understood everything. He let out a great laugh and cursed back,

"I should thank you, this fellow surnamed Bai, for blocking Dongchang's reinforcements up north, allowing me to abandon darkness for light! This shows that on the path of surrendering to Song, Daoist Bai could serve as my master!"

Yehui cupped his hands.

"I wouldn't dare! I learned this from Daoist Master Changyun back in the day. You and I... should be disciple-brothers instead!"

They exchanged glances and laughed together, heading into the city as one. Yehui looked him up and down and said,

"Daoist Friend's injuries don't appear too severe."

At the mention of his injuries, Qiao Wenliu's teeth practically ached,

"Daoist Bai must know—King Wei is now a Great Daoist Master... Though my Lesser Yin divine ability is formidable, how could it compensate for the gap between realms? The injuries are actually quite deep, but I hastily withdrew, treated King Wei well, then found those delicate wives and beautiful concubines of mine to engage in joys of deep union and harmonize yin and yang... If you hadn't suddenly interrupted, I'd be in even better condition."

Yehui raised his brows.

"A Bright Yang injury... you actually have someone suitable?"

Qiao Wenliu lifted his head with a smile.

"I'm far-sighted—could I not have calculated this day would come? Years ago when I first heard of this great matter, I specifically sought out Veiled Yin cultivation methods and had a delicate wife cultivate them. Now she's come in handy at just the right time."

Yehui was quite familiar with him. This man's conduct was unbridled, marked by much greed, and no small number of ill reputes stemmed from this. In earlier years, he'd delighted in dueling with others to practice his arts of healing through intercourse, while simultaneously taking in numerous beautiful concubines, aspiring to collect all Five Virtues and Twelve Qi. Back then he already had thirty-one wives; now there must be even more. Not bothering to inquire further, he asked,

"Where is King Wei?"

"He went north, probably to inspect those two passes at Yun and Pu. Only the Eldest Highness remains here, currently in the side hall."

The two arrived at the great hall and took their seats together. Only then did Yehui lower his voice,

"Though I have some understanding of the mountains and rivers here, I don't know the northern figures. Whether this place can be fought for, how long it might take... I'm afraid I'll need fellow Daoist's guidance."

Clearly, Bai Ziyu was eager to return for closed-door cultivation and unwilling to engage in prolonged warfare in the Central Plains, so he was particularly concerned with Li Zhouwei's next moves. Qiao Wenliu obviously saw through this and said through gritted teeth,

"Are you about to break through?"

Yehui stroked his beard without speaking.

Qiao Wenliu gained his understanding and sneered coldly,

"Purple Mystery has blocked me for eighty-one years—long enough indeed. Master Gu prescribed a formula for me, but it requires Lesser Scenery Mysterious Dampness, and I don't have your good fortune to easily have spiritual items at hand."

Yehui's gaze flickered slightly, as if connecting something. Qiao Sanyi didn't elaborate further, contemplating for a moment before saying,

"I think... it will be very difficult to continue eastward."

He swept his hand across the table, and mountains, rivers, and waterways manifested. To the south, Dangyin lay west and Juan City east. To the north, Guangping was west and Dongchang east, forming a four-cornered formation.

North of Guangping lay another point—precisely Wei Prefecture.

He said flatly, "Though the land beneath the Taihang Mountains is vast, and though Guangping, Wei Prefecture, and the territory north of Dongchang still hold a hundred li of Zhao soil, there are no natural defenses. Ultimately there are only these five locations. Now that we have lost the initiative, having recovered Juan City, we can already establish a foothold. They will certainly abandon Wei Prefecture and Dongchang to seek Yan Kingdom's intervention."

"Once they abandon them, we must take them. Otherwise, if Yan Kingdom seizes them, Dangyin will have no mountain or river defenses, our rear will be critically endangered—how could we have time to continue eastward? And Gu Prefecture likewise has defenses. To continue east would be far from easily accomplished."

Qiao Wenliu sighed,

"No matter how formidable King Wei is, he's still just one man. How many divine ability users does Gu Prefecture have? How many Maha does Yan Kingdom possess?"

Yehui narrowed his eyes, "I know we must take them. It's only a question of how much."

Qiao Wenliu said in a low voice,

"In my view, to the west we cannot take Wei Prefecture—we should take Guangping. To the east, seizing Dongchang will suffice."

"Guangping has immortal mountains and is a strategic pass. Wei Prefecture has long had its earth veins extracted. The difficulty of defending Guangping versus defending Wei Prefecture is like heaven and earth... The He clan of Wei Prefecture has always had ambiguous relations with Yan Kingdom. Why abandon a fine immortal mountain stronghold to take on a burden?"

His expression grew more earnest,

"But I am, after all, a newly surrendered person, and the He clan has kinship ties with the Qiao family. Some things are difficult for me to say more about. Though King Wei is luminous and magnanimous, who knows if others might think differently? Please, Daoist Bai, convey these words on my behalf, saying only that your Capital Guard considered this. Under no circumstances mention me."

Yehui seemed to see this side of him for the first time. His expression showed a touch of surprise as he laughed,

"Remarkable! You, Qiao Sanyi... actually have some sincerity!"

A smile appeared on Qiao Wenliu's face. He shook his head with ambiguous meaning,

"Don't look at my Qiao clan—though we're prosperous now, back before I emerged onto the scene, my Qiao family was impoverished and desperate in this city. Our current respectability all comes from me."

"In terms of emotion and reason, of circumstances and advantage, for half-baked great clans like us, for rogue cultivators who've attained the Dao... do I really need to say where opportunities lie?"

......

Storm clouds roiled.

East of Juan City, mountains and rivers rose and fell. River waters meandered, undulating constantly, soon flowing past the prefecture border and disappearing into the vast eastern night.

The Tang waters originating from Dangyin had already flowed south. This waterway originated from the great river, its color azure-blue and particularly distinctive, emanating waves of Converging Water qi. Though merely a tributary, its spiritual qi was exceptionally abundant, making it an extremely crucial cultivation site for both Juan and Yun cities.

This was the Ji River.

Mountain forests were immersed in ink-like night. Groves of leaves rustled in the wind. One could vaguely make out a figure standing quietly atop a bare bluestone slope.

He wore only simple black robes. The originally bright golden patterns had dimmed in the night, leaving only his eyes still luminous in the darkness. This King Wei, whose fame shook north and south, this newly advanced Great Daoist Master of Bright Yang, stood alone like an ordinary mortal upon this nameless hill.

This hill was where the Ji River flowed past, also the easternmost point of Juan City. Standing upon this hill, the great eastern city seemed close at hand.

'Yun City.'

This city and Juan City lay east and west of each other, like twins from one mother, yet was even more imposing, causing this King Wei to ponder endlessly.

'Qiao Wenliu said... originally there weren't so many imposing cities here. It was when True Monarch of Treasured Earth established his sect here in those days, and the later Sheji also resided in this place. There were matters involving great divine abilities, hence towering mountains arose. Where there are mountains, there are formations to defend...'

Li Zhouwei gazed for a long time, his heart reaching a decision.

'I'm afraid... Wei Prefecture won't be easy to take. As long as the Daoist Masters of Gu Prefecture don't act foolishly, they'll certainly draw the Northern Buddhists into the game...'

Actually, this wasn't such a great surprise. He'd long anticipated his current predicament. Coming eastward, his greatest objective was still the Ji River—whatever schemes the Dragon-kin were plotting, he'd rather know sooner than later...

'Now the Compassion Dao will certainly make moves quickly. To continue eastward, Yun City has a Great Daoist Master stationed there and cannot be swiftly conquered. Guangping and Dangyin will certainly be exploited by Yan Kingdom.'

'Tang Jiyu, Zhou Feng, Qiao Wenliu...'

'Is it enough?'

Actually, obtaining Qiao Wenliu was already an enormous gain, yet he ultimately was unwilling to withdraw easily.

'Not enough.'

He understood that now he could only advance, not retreat. If he couldn't gather sufficient support, once pressure from Yan Kingdom and Gu Prefecture shifted over, he might not even be able to hold the four prefectures he was about to grasp!

His gaze stared into the horizon, his thoughts gradually growing complex, until finally he closed both eyes, as if resting with eyes shut.

Spirit Probe!

In an instant, his spiritual awareness had surged ten thousand zhang into the high sky, looking down upon all living things from above. The mysterious formation shrouding the distant city became transparent in a flash, presenting all internal scenes one by one.

In the high hall, divine abilities stood in rows—some holding jade plates, some sitting cross-legged, some cradling scrolls. The radiance of various divine abilities interwove together, making even that great hall seem cramped.

'Qiao Sanyi... if Song forces attack, we should capture this man first...'

'Li Zhouwei is battle-hardened... would he attack head-on? He'll likely take another route. We must pay more attention to the north...'

'Pay attention? Should it be us paying attention? The north seems silent, but wherever he attacks, once he moves, how could the Compassion Dao sit idly by?'

As everyone debated, the youth seated at the head remained silent, looking toward the elder at his side.

The old man likewise sat cross-legged in concentration, silent, yet all manner of mysteries gathered upon him. Powerful dharma power condensed into one body, disturbing the spiritual mechanism of the Great Void, deadly silent!

Various voices interwove like flowing water, all surfacing before his eyes. Yet Li Zhouwei paid no attention to their various speculations, only sweeping over them once, taking their measure.

'Indeed there's a Great Daoist Master... and two mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators... perhaps others are still on the way...'

This force, speaking of strength, was truly first-rate under heaven. But with proper arrangements, the forces in Li Zhouwei's hands likewise had confidence in victory through battle.

'Unfortunately, there are worries behind...'

He surveyed for a time, ultimately gaining no greater harvest and was about to return, when suddenly an unusual sensation surged in his heart.

"Hm?"

A faint coolness rushed to his brow. He felt the tactile sensation of his body in the cold wind. The Shengyang Acupoint trembled slightly as divine abilities illuminated together, yet showed faint signs of fluctuation.

That thing that had lain in his Shengyang Acupoint for so many years—the bare Talisman Seed—actually moved slightly!

This movement stirred all the qi mechanisms throughout his body. Li Zhouwei was immediately alarmed. The vision before his eyes began moving slowly yet firmly, turning toward the east of Yun City!

In that instant, he felt an extremely profound spiritual mechanism surge into both eyes. His original vision suddenly expanded like a straight line from west to east, once again piercing through a thousand li, passing through layer upon layer of obstacles, immortal mountain after imposing city, finally falling upon a small city protected by countless great mountains.

This was...

This city was thoroughly ancient, with blue bricks and black tiles. Flickering divine abilities like stars adorned this place. Li Zhouwei's vision expanded with a thunderous roar. Unlike his usual Spirit Probe, which was like seeing with the naked eye, his sight had permeated nearly every corner of this small city. All manner of information surged like flooding waters into his mind.

'Center of the realm, Gu Prefecture, Taishu Kuangyi...'

'Human Emperor, Daochun, Chun City...'

At this very moment, even the vast forms of secret realms and grotto-heavens flickering throughout this place illuminated together before his eyes. Though difficult to penetrate within, the various colors above entered his vision!

Yet that peculiar attraction ignored all these things, dragging him faster and faster, like a spring swallow in flight, speeding past bluestone surfaces to arrive before a small courtyard.

This courtyard was painted in green lacquer, even covered with the mottling of years, appearing simple and natural. Above the not-wide door frame hung a plaque, its characters flowing like dragons and phoenixes in dance.

Wenhuang Residence!

This instant of pause seemed illusory. His vision had already passed through the hall, arriving before the main seat. Before red wooden table and chairs sat a desk with pure white proclamation paper spread upon it. Cinnabar and azure brushes lay to one side, their master seemingly long vanished.

Yet his gaze swept past all these seemingly simple yet immeasurably precious objects without the slightest pause, as if he, Li Zhouwei, stood right there. He slowly raised his head, his gaze settling upon the eaves.

Upon the gray-black wooden beam rested an azure box.

The azure box was filled with various peculiar white porcelain fragments, saturated with transparent liquid. Talisman papers lay within, their sutras wondrous and elegant. Yet his vision concentrated not on these conspicuous things but on that utterly unremarkable white stone fallen into the corner—a small porcelain fragment.

This fragment took the shape of a triangular diamond, thin as cicada wings, yet made his eyes ache with icy cold, his heart transmitting wave after wave of palpitations.

In this instant, the pure white radiance of this fragment flashed in the hearts of every talisman recipient from south to north, all sensing it alike. Li Zhouwei felt as if rising from the Nine Nethers, heaven and earth inverted, returning to his original body from an extremely distant place!

The sky was pitch black, the mountain winds whistling. In the darkness those two points of gold lit up, his eyes calm as water, yet within his heart surged thick killing intent and unshakeable resolve.

'Gu Prefecture... fragment...'

'Immortal Mirror fragment!'
