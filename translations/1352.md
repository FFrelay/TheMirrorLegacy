# Chapter 1352 Humiliation

The setting sun was like blood.

The light in the pavilion was as illusory as a dream, and when the radiance of Converging Water blossomed across the sky, Fu He’s complexion had already grown pale. It was less that the outcome was blinding and more that it was a final verification.

This left his mind a complete blank.

Gu You!

To put it bluntly, this Great Daoist Master was like a rabid dog that didn't even fear death. If he came storming back in a fit of rage, how could he possibly be spared!

He had not been without thoughts of these consequences before. As long as Li Zhouwei killed Gu You, then no matter how much hatred burned in Longkang Yao's heart, the debt of vengeance would have to be settled with Bright Yang, and he would first need the aid of the Fu clan… Even if he sensed something was wrong, he would merely assume it was the scheme of some great personage…

But what about now?

Pang Yi's words were too fatal—he had even pointed out the pawn, Ye Tuji, and mentioned all those other words, some true and some false. Once all of this was established as fact, Longkang Yao would realize that a specific person had been guiding him, rather than it being the arrangement of some great lord!

'He truly dares to kill people!'

He stood frozen on the spot, but Pang Queyun at his side sighed, finally stepping forward to speak,

"Daoist Master Ye, you should leave quickly!"

The old man seemed exasperated by the antics of these juniors. While holding back his eldest son, whose face was cold with indifference, he sighed and said,

"It was merely a slight misjudgment, and fortunately, nothing has happened yet. Fellow Daoist Fu has nothing to fear, but you, a mere rogue cultivator… that may not be the case… Enter the Great Void, leave with your head held high, go deep into the Eastern Sea, and never set foot on the mainland again in this life…"

Ye Tuji's gaze was icy, sweeping over Pang Yi with a look of disappointment, as if scolding him for failing to live up to expectations. He turned, his voice laced with chill, and said indifferently,

"You all know in your hearts about the peculiarities surrounding Daoist Master Gu! There's no need to use these venomous schemes on me. The resources at Moongaze Lake are plentiful; this old senior should walk his bright and grand patht!"

His words struck a nerve, but Pang Queyun merely sighed and said,

"Such words are inappropriate… How could saving Daoist Master Gu be considered a bright and grand path? Does the Daoist Master mean to say that Daoist Master Gu also took benefits from King Wei and was completely unharmed? And can therefore promote an old man like me…"

He sneered. Ye Tuji simply suppressed his anger and ignored him, taking a few steps forward to help Fu He up. He grabbed the talisman from the table, stuffed it into Fu He's robes, and said,

"Our hearts are set on the light, what is there to fear! The talisman from Vast Plateau Heaven is here; could it be that Vast Plateau Heaven also means to harm Daoist Master Gu?"

_Boom!_

Before his voice had even faded, an expanse of azure had already swallowed the horizon like roiling storm clouds. The man in the sky stood amidst the clouds, holding the sheaths of two swords at his waist with one hand, his gaze fixed icily upon them!

His clothes were tattered from the great battle, and now, his wounds were healing as if they were breathing, revealing the wheat-colored flesh beneath. The rumbling Converging Water coalesced behind him, making him resemble a river god stepping out from an ancient scroll.

There were no questions.

There was no hesitation.

_Clang!_

Gu You drew his sword.

In the next instant, endless ocean waves materialized between the two of them, as if everything else had receded in that moment. Only a vast, boundless ocean remained between them, yet it was cleaved open by the sword light, revealing thousands upon thousands of shrimp soldiers and crab generals thronging on either side.

A bright white glint of sword light, like a vertical and horizontal stroke, had already shot forth like a comet, hurtling toward Ye Tuji!

The entire assembly was stunned!

Even though these people had long heard of his ill repute and knew he would not let matters rest upon his return, who could have imagined he would draw his sword in front of all the divine ability users of Chun City, upon this very lake where a True Monarch had once cultivated!

Pang Yi and the others retreated in an instant, aghast, while Fu He, as if splashed awake by ice-cold water, felt his expression change drastically. He brandished his divine ability and placed his other hand on his friend's shoulder.

『Valley of True Origin』!

The radiance of the Bound Earth divine ability erupted, yet it seemed feeble amidst the sky-piercing, earth-shattering glow of Converging Water, and appeared to further provoke the opponent's wrath. The Converging Water divine ability immediately responded.

『Where Currents Return』!

What kind of person was Gu You! His Converging Water divine ability was exceedingly tyrannical; even Li Zhouwei, with his four Bright Yang divine abilities, had to resort to trickery to capture him. How could a mere divine ability like this possibly block him?

The overlapping mountains that loomed over them pressed closer, only to be smashed to pieces before the boundless ocean. This radiance of this Bound Earth divine ability was forcibly blasted apart, exploding into a sky full of brown light!

Only then did Ye Tuji react.

The glow of Radiant Fire lit up around him, but before the divine ability could even fully manifest, it was submerged by the boundless Converging Water. This Great Daoist Master showed not a shred of mercy. His figure appeared silently behind him, and the brilliant blue was reflected in pupils that were exceptionally cold with fury.

『Demonic Defiled River』!

Ye Tuji was violently suppressed within it.

The might of this Converging Water was infinite. Even within the 『Imperial Observation of the Origin』, it had dared to flow wantonly. Now, unleashed at full power, it trapped him completely. Meanwhile, the man behind him merely stood there, a sarcastic smile playing on his lips.

He raised his hand and seized Ye Tuji by the neck, his eyes burning with a vicious flame, as if he wanted to incinerate him to dust.

Gu You said icily, Back then… in that great hall, I already wanted to beat you to death."

His voice was somewhat hoarse, yet it plunged the courtyard into silence. Pang Yi's expression changed slightly as he lowered his head and retreated behind his father. Fu He's eyes were filled with horror; he moved his lips, and finally took a step forward, saying through gritted teeth,

"Daoist Master Gu! Don't be rash! We were also…"

His words cut off abruptly—the man had already turned his head slowly to gaze at him, and said softly,

"Either wait for death, or tell Fu Tanjian to get his ass over here."

Fu He felt a chill shoot from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. But in that fatal moment, Ye Tuji, who had been trapped in the layers of Converging Water and had not resisted, finally spoke,

"Daoist Master Gu! Don't be used as someone else's blade! Who was it that abandoned you at the second pass, leading to this day of schemes? We were worried sick, only to be plotted against in return…"

The young man slowly shifted his gaze back, staring at the Ye Tuji before him. His hand tightened in an instant, silencing all his words. The corner of his mouth curled up as he said indifferently,

"Fellow Daoist Lu!"

Lu An had watched this whole drama unfold, standing aside and minding his own business. He understood that the current Gu You was like an enraged beast who absolutely could not be offended. He hurriedly stepped forward and said,

"Great Daoist Master…"

"Lend me a cauldron."

The two Lus of that era each possessed a cauldron, which led later Lu clansmen to favor refining cauldrons. Lu Fu had one, as did Lu An. He gently turned over his hand, revealing a small cauldron no bigger than his palm, but hesitated to speak.

Gu You took it and sneered, My apologies for the offense."

It was unclear whether he said this to Lu An or to Ye Tuji, but he gripped the cauldron with one hand, his five fingers locking onto its body, while his other hand clutched Ye Tuji and smashed him straight into the small cauldron's mouth!

_Boom!_

The sound of a Dharma Body exploding rang out. Ye Tuji forcibly twisted his neck, trying to break free, but his nature was of fire virtue, not adept at escape. How could he possibly flee from Converging Water?

After only a few exchanges, he was brought back by the Converging Water divine ability. Gu You nonchalantly seized him again and smashed him once more against the cauldron's mouth.

_Crack…_

This time it was the crisp sound of splintering bone. The Great Daoist Master's hands surged with power, his knuckles turning white as he forcibly pressed Ye Tuji's head into the cauldron. Only then did he release his grip slightly, clamping the body with his elbow and continuing to stuff it into the cauldron with a blank expression.

_Crick... crackle..._

It was as if he wanted to stuff Ye Tuji entirely into a cauldron that was barely the size of his palm!

Fu He had spent years cultivating in a grotto-heaven; when had he ever witnessed such a horrifying scene of a divine ability user being so humiliated? Gu You's arrogance and recklessness were such that not only he, but even the Pang father and son duo standing behind him, stared wide-eyed, looking up in disbelief.

_Snap…_

The horrifying sounds echoed across the lake. Fu He's lips were pale as he hurriedly crushed the talisman in his sleeve while quickly turning his head to look for someone.

'Where is Longkang Yao!'

At this very moment, who could possibly order this Great Daoist Master around?

Only Longkang Yao!

But there was only silence by the lake—the Great Daoist Master seemed to have vanished.

_Crack..._

The crisp sound rang out again. Fu He felt a vein throbbing in his temple, causing a sharp pain in his mind. He turned his head, full of hatred, only to find Pang Yi staring at the ground, apparently also terrified.

_Boom!_

A violent roar thundered across the sky as Radiant Fire spilled everywhere. Ye Tuji had thought there would be a chance to explain himself and felt that resistance was meaningless, but by the time he realized what his opponent was doing, it was already too late. His Radiant Fire divine ability repeatedly bloomed in the sky, only to be brought back each time by streams of Converging Water.

『All Convergences Return』.

This Great Daoist Master was extremely meticulous, using every aspect of his divine ability in accordance with the true meaning of Converging Water, finally trapping Ye Tuji inside the tiny cauldron!

With the abilities of a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, let alone being stuffed into a tiny cauldron, even transforming into a grain of sand would take but a single thought. The humiliation in this act, however, was simply beyond words!

Gu You, however, simply flicked the golden blood from his hands, lifted the cauldron in satisfaction, and swept his gaze over the crowd before finally asking,

"Is that Daoist Master Ye inside?"

A dead silence.

In the next moment, Ye Tuji's voice, fearless and filled with both hatred and fury, exploded from within. He seemed to have already accepted his fate and just laughed heartily.

"Is the Daoist Master looking for that rash, reckless, arrogant, and conceited fool who was captured by the Qilin…"

His laughter cut off abruptly, sealed by the dense Converging Water divine ability. Gu You turned his head impassively, his somewhat slender black pupils gazing at the old man as he smiled and said,

"Daoist Master Pang? Not coming up to verify it?"

Even though Pang Queyun was a dignified mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, his back grew cold hearing these words. He understood that Gu You was retaliating overtly, and his heart was filled with both ice and shock. He only lowered his head and cupped his hands, not answering him.

Just at this impasse, someone finally came strolling slowly from the horizon.

Longkang Yao trod upon flames, seemingly returning from a scenic tour, his expression impassive.

Fu He practically saw his savior, bowing down and crying out,

"Great Daoist Master! Fellow Daoist Ye was merely anxious! He never had any intention of causing offense… It was neither treason nor a crime, just a few words based on his judgment of the facts! Why humiliate a subordinate in front of everyone!"

Longkang Yao's expression was indifferent. He walked through the air step by step, his voice very soft,

"Gu You, this is, after all, a place where a True Monarch cultivated. How can we have it stained by blood? Take him elsewhere to play."

These words were spoken with almost perfect courtesy, yet they were like ten-thousand-year-old ice, sending a collective shiver through the crowd below. Fu He was frozen in place, only hearing Gu You let out a cold laugh in the sky. With a forceful wave of his sleeve, the Converging Water divine ability, the golden cauldron, and everything in the sky, including himself, vanished.

Yet everything somehow seemed even more chilling.

The golden boots soon landed before him. Fu He raised his head, bit by bit, to see the Great Daoist Master's red robes fluttering slightly in the wind, and the condescending coldness and disappointment in his eyes.

It was disappointment.

He said softly, "When I was away, Xu Jiaoyan once sought me out and told me this was a total mess that I shouldn't touch. He said that if it came to a clash with Bright Yang, a true life-and-death struggle, even the most powerful figures would die…"

"But I still came out of the grotto-heaven."

A complex emotion flickered in the depths of Longkang Yao's eyes.

Back when he was young, he had studied in Gu Prefecture, growing up under the tutelage of these very Daoist Masters. Although they had all passed away in the end, he always remembered the debt of gratitude he owed them.

Thus, when the cultivators in the grotto-heaven were engaged in heated debate, he, Longkang Yao, was willing to step forward, willing to enter the mortal world, to reclaim the last shred of dignity for Gu Prefecture—the heart of the northern Immortal Dao and the home of the descendants of the Three Profundities.

The coldness in his eyes gradually turned to fury as he said condescendingly,

"If I had not descended the mountain, who in the east could have stopped Li Zhouwei! Yu Xixin? Or that old Daoist Master Shangguan? Do you… have any idea what you are doing?"

His icy words echoed, seemingly directed not only at Fu He before him, but also at the various eyes and ears within the Great Void.

"Did you think that great battle at Mount Jiao and Chefu was just a probe? If someone else had gone, what would the outcome have been? If not for me, that ambush by Li Zhouwei would have surely been the fuse that led to the collapse of all of Chun City! This place would have long been shepherded by Bright Yang, yet you think I merely suffered a simple setback in the east!"

He was so furious he began to laugh.

"Yes… it would have been a good thing if you were easily subdued… but what if some great lord had used you as a blade?"

"Your entire sect, from top to bottom, would have suffered a miserable fate, with countless lives lost… Today, I stand here shouldering the great burden for you, and not only does no one step up to help, but you plot against me instead!"

His last words were like a clap of thunder, booming between heaven and earth and echoing endlessly over the lake. Longkang Yao's eyes finally lowered slowly, his gaze falling upon Fu He, as cold as frost.

"And you."

As his voice fell, rhombus-shaped shuttles emerged, swimming along the flames. They continuously assembled, trapping Fu He within them. A sharpening aura pressed in, bit by bit, constantly slicing at his protective divine ability and causing bursts of fire to erupt.

"I really ought to thank you…"

Longkang Yao said coldly,

"If not for this little stunt of yours, I would have thought everyone would show some mutual respect. I never imagined… I truly never imagined… that you would be so eager to curry favor with your superiors that you would resort to any means necessary!"

_Boom!_

"Enough!"

Thunder roared between heaven and earth, and finally, a cold voice was heard from afar.

"Longkang Yao! You really dare to say anything, don't you!"

An intense purple light condensed on the horizon amid overlapping gales and downpours. A middle-aged man clad in a Feathered Robe with a crimson mark between his brows and a frigid expression flew over, treading across the lake's surface as he approached from the distance!

His aura was overwhelming, but the person before him paid it no mind. Longkang Yao seized Fu He from the ground without warning, hoisted him high, his face overflowing with rage, and abruptly turned his head to shout,

"What is there that I don't dare to say? What is there that I don't dare to say? I say that you, Fu Tanjian, curry favor with your superiors and bully your subordinates—"

In an instant, infinite flames exploded in the Great Void, transforming into all manner of circling phoenixes that mercilessly engulfed the man in the distance. Longkang Yao stared at him, stepping forward one pace at a time, his expression composed, his voice cold and hoarse.

"You will obediently take this from me!"

The middle-aged man in the distance raised a hand, batting aside all the intense flames. He had already stepped into the pavilion. Looking at his eldest son, clutched in the Great Daoist Master's hand, a flash of exasperated anger—the kind one feels for a child who fails to live up to expectations—crossed his eyes. He raised his hand without a word, but the Great Daoist Master dodged it without a shred of courtesy.

Longkang Yao said indifferently, "Get lost."

The middle-aged Daoist Master's expression instantly darkened. The Daoist Master in Longkang Yao's hand vanished into thin air. The Great Daoist Master of Blazing Fire now had a small, red-pill-like Spiritual Treasure in his hand, which he tossed lightly. He didn't even look at the other man directly, giving him only a cold profile as he said casually,

"Do you take me for a fool? You're in such a rush to please your disciple-brother, isn't it all because of the Bright Yang affair? But Chun City, I will protect it, and that's final."

These few words seemed more terrifying than the life of his eldest son, causing the middle-aged Daoist Master's face to change color abruptly. He opened his mouth to speak but was calmly interrupted by the man before him,

"Have Feng Xiu come to Blazing Aridity Heaven and ask for him personally."
