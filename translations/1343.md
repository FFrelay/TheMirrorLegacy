# Chapter 1343: Requesting Release

Mount Qingdu.

"Dong!"

The melodious toll of a bell echoed through the mountains. Fine rain accompanied the reverberations amidst the rustling forest leaves. Figures hurried along the bluestone path that had weathered the vicissitudes of time. A burly man was striding forward, his expression grim.

Li Zhouda had rushed back from the north very early, looking travel-worn. This Celestial Thunder cultivator had fought in wars for many years but never learned to disguise his feelings. His joy and anger remained visible on his face. He turned his head and asked in a low voice,

"Where is Fourth Brother?"

The man following closely beside him wore a suit of armor. It was Li Suikuan, who had just returned from the lake surroundings. The young man lowered his head and said,

"A letter was sent to the palace days ago, but there is no reply yet..."

Li Zhouda was never one to indulge others. Seeing someone of higher seniority, he would still scold them if he felt they deserved it. Even though this elder brother of his was already extremely noble and important, he still sighed and said,

"I see... he has gotten used to being that Marquis Anyang of his. It is fine if he does not return usually... but to not even move for the Old Master's affairs!"

Li Suikuan was shaken by these words. He looked around and hurriedly tried to appease him,

"My Lord, please quell your anger... The distance between the two places is far. Whether he is in seclusion or deep cultivation, there are times when one cannot be reached. Moreover, Youngest Uncle is also on the lake. These words are always bad to speak..."

Hearing him mention Li Jiangchun, the disappointment in Li Zhouda's eyes subsided slightly, and he only said,

"Jiangchun is good; he knows to return early..."

Li Suikuan dared not respond further and simply led him up, but they ran into a woman on the mountain path. She was born with an air of grace and nobility. Now middle-aged, sudden grey hairs had appeared. She stared at Li Zhouda and said softly,

"The Marquis Anyang has already arrived. Jiangchun went to the lakeside to welcome him... You and your mouth, you still do not learn!"

Li Zhouda, however, did not care for this elder brother who had traveled far away for many years to enjoy fortune in a foreign land. He displayed everything on his face, shaking his head as he said,

"Even Ding Mu came three months early. He wanted to pay respects several times and is still waiting at the foot of the mountain right now. As a direct grandson, how could he arrive so late? No one else dares to speak of him, but I do."

Another person was coming up the mountain, so Li Minggong stopped her reprimand. She sighed and whispered, "Just follow me up..."

The higher they went, the quieter it became. The rain outside was ceaseless and bitingly cold. Several people stood inside a quiet side hall, conversing in low tones. Without needing to think, it must be that eldest brother, Li Zhoufang.

As the biological father of Li Queyi and Li Jiangzong, this eldest brother now held a very high status within the clan, though he had not managed affairs much in recent years.

Outside stood Li Queyi, wiping the corners of her eyes while talking to Xia Shouyu beside her.

The main hall had black roof tiles and high vermilion structures, polished from bluestone. The hall doors were tightly shut. The young master who usually wore red now wore a rare black outer robe, sitting on the steps with a look of utter helplessness. Beside him, Sun Bai held a medicine pot in silence.

Li Zhouda asked in a low voice, "Where have all the people gone?"

Li Suikuan replied in an equally low voice, "Uncle Jiangzong and Brother Suihuan are still at the foot of the mountain making preparations. People came up earlier, but most were turned away. Lately, the Old Master prefers peace..."

"True enough..."

Li Zhouda finally fell silent. He performed a greeting and quietly walked to the front of the ancestral hall. Protected by a great formation, he could only peek in through the open crack of a window. He discovered the old man kneeling in the center, curled up as if shrinking, leaving only a view of his back.

That back was so small, resembling a ball of skin shrunk over a skeletal frame, shivering in the wind.

Li Zhouda immediately turned his head, retreated two steps, and moved to the side. This man of decisive character, clear in his love and hate, covered his face and wept silently.

_Patter!_

The mountain rain grew heavier, smashing clatteringly against the eaves. Light like silver and mercury reflected before the hall. A woman with a pearl dot on her brow stepped out, and everyone instantly shivered, preparing to rise and bow.

Li Quewan raised her hand and gently stopped them, halting everyone's movements. Behind her, amidst multicolored clouds, stood two people—one old and one young, one noble beyond the mundane, one carefree as an immortal.

It was Li Zhouluo and his son.

Li Zhouluo had specially changed his clothes to come. Dressed simply in black, his feet firmly on the ground, he immediately stepped forward. He swept a glance through that window and quickly retreated. Walking two steps, he happened to discover his clan brother sitting below the steps.

The two made eye contact and realized both their faces were covered in tears. Although this burly man had been cursing about this elder brother earlier, the moment they met, it seemed nothing needed to be said. Disregarding everything else, he took his hand, and they embraced and wept bitterly.

Li Quewan did not come forward. She took a step and turned sideways in front of the great hall to welcome someone. After merely a few breaths, a bright Heavenly Light lit up from the horizon, approaching at a terrifying speed. It restrained itself upon reaching the mountain, transforming into a man in white-gold Daoist robes who drifted down lightly. Even the rain in heaven and earth was not scattered by his arrival.

Li Ximing.

"Great-Uncle!"

Li Quewan called out, but Li Ximing, who had always valued her, had already lost his composure. He nodded hurriedly and stepped forward. The young master guarding the door rose with extreme speed, bowed to the ground, and wept.

"Grandfather!"

This Daoist Master, currently the one closest to Li Xuanxuan, had finally arrived. It was like casting a calming stone into the water. All sorts of gazes gathered around as Li Ximing asked,

"How is the situation?"

Li Quewan whispered from the side, "These past days... the Old Master has not seen anyone. Only occasionally, when the weather is clear and bright, will there be days he goes out, yet he never goes beyond these two great halls. Sometimes, halfway down the mountain, he recalls old matters, and Uncle hires an opera troupe to sing for him..."

In these days, Li Zhouming had not left his side, waiting at the entrance of the ancestral hall at all times. Every time the old man went out for a walk, he wished he could bring all the good things from the lake over. He even personally took to the stage, singing, reciting, acting, and fighting, just to earn a moment of the old man's lingering attention...

After these days, his face had become much paler, and he wore no cosmetic powder. He was the clearest on these finer details, and at this moment, he wept.

"The Old Ancestor... is already confused. He cannot remember clearly. I... as long as I wear white when I go in, the old man calls me Ping'er. If I wear black, he calls me Yuanjiao... Sometimes he remembers wrongly and asks me... asks me... if Eastern Yue is still invading the border."

He wiped his tears and continued, "Later, the Old Master would not even take medicine. He sealed up the great hall day by day, and there were always all kinds of voices inside..."

Li Ximing’s heart jolted. He gritted his teeth, let out a deep breath, and turned around. 

"All of you, step down for now."

For a moment, everyone retreated, leaving only Li Quewan, Li Jiangchun, and a few others. Li Zhouming walked two steps but was stopped by the Daoist Master.

Li Ximing said in a low voice, "You stay as well. Wait in front of the hall."

He pushed the door open and entered gently. He found the lamp fires burning brightly, the scent of incense extremely thick. The old man knelt on a prayer mat, still showing no reaction. So he turned around and sealed the inside and outside with a divine ability.

Earlier, the heavy rain outside and the interwoven sounds of weeping had failed to disturb this old man in the slightest. But the moment the divine ability sealed the great hall, it was as if something invisible touched his soul, causing the old man to tremblingly straighten his body.

"Who?"

His voice was hoarse.

"Grandfather..."

Li Ximing took a step forward and saw the old man who had straightened up.

Li Xuanxuan was extremely thin.

He could faintly remember that when he was babbling as a toddler, Li Xuanxuan had doted on him greatly. That face had been broad, and people said he had good fortune. When that large hand held his small hand, it was warm and rough, with calluses left on the fingertips from holding a talisman brush for years.

But now, when that face lifted, it was withered and thin like a skull. Unsightly arcs of varying depth protruded from his skin. His clothes hung loosely on his body, and his outstretched hand seemed like a layer of skin hanging on a reed stalk, light and brittle.

Those eyes embedded in the skull seemed just like a ghost's—this body, patched and mended, destroyed again and again over the years, could no longer carry the weight of his soul.

Li Ximing began to tremble. He reached out his hand, wanting to use a divine ability to sustain his body, but the old man shook his head slightly yet firmly. His tongue seemed already numb, his speech slurred.

"Ming'er..."

He saw his grandfather take out the object he had been hugging in his bosom all along.

It was a bow.

Entirely black, having weathered the vicissitudes of time. It used the tendon of some unknown small demon, and its frame had long since scattered. The spiritual qi was so faint it seemed nonexistent, and the string hung loosely upon it.

The Azure Crow Bow.

The old man's body seemed to have collapsed long ago. He simply held this bow respectfully, propping it against his waist and abdomen, allowing him to lie on the ground in a posture that was neither kneeling nor prone. Li Ximing's eyes instantly turned red. Disregarding the old man's words, he supported his hands and used a continuous stream of life force to hang onto his life-mandate.

Li Xuanxuan gasped for breath. Regaining spirit slowly, he actually began to smile. He said softly,

"In the past... when my Li clan members passed away in meditation, some were like Second Uncle and Xuanfeng—farsighted, pointing out a smooth path for you all. Others were like Ping'er and Xicheng—managing the family for years, writing books to be handed down. Or like Yuanjiao and Xijun—fighting with their bodies, gambling for a chance at advancement..."

"But I, Li Xuanxuan, have always been mediocre. I have dragged out an ignoble existence until now. This skill in talismans, looking at it now, is nothing more than the stuff of rogue cultivators on the street, not worth mentioning..."

He spoke softly.

"Zhouwei and Jiangqian are outside; Quewan and you are inside. Below are children like Suihuan, Jiangzong, and Suining. The inheritance is orderly. I can go back and give an account to the elders... Only one thing remains."

Li Ximing raised his head and listened. Li Xuanxuan murmured,

"Xuanfeng... still has a child outside. Qinghong knows of it too... He entrusted it back then... I have no more opportunity..."

"Ximing has noted it down..."

Li Ximing replied. Li Xuanxuan stared blankly at him several times, panting violently. There was strength between his lips and teeth, but his eyes slowly reddened.

"Ming'er, I should go back... Ming'er... Grandmother died in that courtyard, Grandfather collapsed on that bed, Father perished before that village entrance... And... Second Uncle... he died on that small hill, and..."

He suddenly began to cry.

"Xiu'er... my son! He is also there... He is still in the thunder and fire. I should go back, Ming'er..."

Li Ximing knew the place he spoke of. It was that tiny village, that small courtyard built of bluestone. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he said hoarsely,

"Your child will take you back..."

But the old man abruptly shook his head. He gasped forcefully twice and said,

"You all still need me... Ming'er, I cannot leave."

Li Ximing did not know how to answer him. He only swallowed his tears, watching as the old man raised his head to gaze at the hazy lights high above, at the pitch-black and crimson spirit tablet.

_Spirit Tablet of Late Father, Lord Li Mutian._

The rain outside was heavy, smashing against the eaves with crisp sounds. Li Xuanxuan slowly gained spirit. He straightened his body and said,

"Ximing... you are the most worthy of pride... Having you is the Li Clan's fortune."

Li Ximing stood rooted to the spot. These words seemed ordinary enough, yet they made his tears flow. He opened his mouth, but in the end, he only spat out a few raw words,

"Grandfather..."

In this moment, it was as if he could disregard everything. Whether it was Purple Mansion spiritual items or the Heavenly One Pure Origin, he wished he could take them out right now and feed them into the old man's mouth. Yet he also understood the determination of the old man before him; he could only stand there blankly.

Li Xuanxuan withdrew his hand from the Daoist Master's grip, no longer accepting the continuous life force being transferred to him. He simply gazed gently at Li Ximing and said,

"Ming'er, you withdraw... Let... Zhouming come in."

In this final moment, whether it was the Daoist Master or the Sword Immortal, the old man did not look to them to entrust hope or protect the clan. Instead, he called the name of the junior who had accompanied him constantly throughout these many years.

Li Ximing knew this was the old man's final look. He took three steps back for every one forward, slowly pacing to the front of the hall, finally hearing his grandfather smile.

"Ming'er... I am leaving today. The affairs of the family—you must bear more of the burden."

"Yes."

_Creak..._

The muffled sound of rain suddenly grew louder. With the sound of light footsteps, it soon returned to a dull noise like distant clamor. The old man knelt quietly until that young master walked all the way to him.

Li Zhouming.

This widely rumored profligate son had taken off both his outer robes, leaving only his close-fitting white clothes. Quietly, even somewhat peacefully, he knelt beside the old man and whispered,

"Old Ancestor."

Li Zhouming had cared for this old man throughout his entire twilight years and understood every one of his items extremely well. In the instant he lowered his head, for some reason, he discovered something unfamiliar beside the prayer mat.

It was a pair of golden beads.

These golden beads were no larger than medicinal pills, seemingly forged from gold and iron, nothing extraordinary about them. Patterns flowed faintly on the surface, stained with a tiny bit of something crimson mixed with green.

In the instant this thought crossed his mind, Li Xuanxuan had already raised his head. His two eyes stared deeply at him as he said softly,

"Ming'er... you are intelligent. The gap between immortal and mortal is hard to bridge. Yuanyun could not see through it, and your father could not see through it, but you can let go. Favor and disgrace, rise and fall—these cannot be easily borne, yet you are willing to bow your head. In the future, should there be a collapse, only your eyes will be able to see it..."

Li Zhouming's thoughts were interrupted in an instant, and he broke out in a cold sweat. He stared straight at the old man before him. But as he met the old man's gaze, this usually hedonistic young master actually calmed down. He said hoarsely,

"Old Ancestor, is it *Lament for the Fleeting River*?"

The old man did not answer him. His withered, weightless hand rested on the young master's body. He struggled to extend his other hand forward, taking a small, empty bamboo container from his waist.

This object looked like a bamboo cup, yet it was deep like a bamboo scroll. Inside lay tokens of various sizes, a finger's width each. IUnder the dim yellow lamplight, one could vaguely see the names of musical pieces written in ink upon them.

The old man tucked the object into his robes and said softly, "Go."

Li Zhouming stood up, knocked his head on the floor twice, and withdrew respectfully. The hall doors closed, isolating inside from outside. Only then did the old man struggle to stand up, walking unsteadily to the candle fire.

He gasped twice but failed to blow out the candle flame. He could only raise his hand and press it out with his fingers. Then, supporting himself on the edge of the table, he extinguished the candle fires in the hall one by one according to order.

Outside, the rain poured, dark and lightless. The entire great hall instantly fell into darkness; only the old man's bright, piercing gaze flickered. He knelt back onto the prayer mat and knocked his head on the ground.

"Li Family Disciple, Li Xuanxuan."

He spoke gently and hoarsely.

"The worldly karma is finished; I bid farewell to Supreme Yin."
