# Chapter 1340: Dire News

"Congratulations, Father!"

Beneath their feet, the mountains and rivers rose and fell. While the black mist in the distance still vied for supremacy against the flames, Radiant Fire had already drifted over. Manifesting before the King Wei, the youth in crimson robes said,

"Father truly possesses divine might!"

Li Jiangqian had been guarding the pass all this time. In recent days, the various divine abilities had been bitterly suppressed by that Great Daoist Master of Converging Water, and he himself had not dared to venture out. Naturally, he held some anger in his heart; now that he could give it vent, his face was full of smiles.

"Ahem... You... have caused trouble again."

Li Jiangqian only nodded in guilt. Li Zhouwei looked at Yang Ruizao, who had followed closely behind with a mix of shock and admiration. Shaking his head somewhat helplessly, Li Zhouwei spat out golden blood mixed with the deep blue of Converging Water, wiping it away casually as he said,

"We have truly troubled the Marquis of Ping'an!"

"Oh..."

Yang Ruizao was a calculating man, however. Regardless of how dissatisfied he might have been earlier, the wood was already carved into a boat. His face remained brimming with smiles as he said,

"Think nothing of it... Since Your Highness employed such brilliant strategy, and we were instructed to guard this city alongside Your Highness, naturally we must do our utmost... This is all within our duty, there is no need to say more!"

The Yang family changed their faces faster than flipping a page. Li Zhouwei, however, knew that he was not the one making the decisions, and said,

"The Great General is still in the south blocking Longkang Yao for me. Naturally, I owe him a debt of gratitude."

Although Li Jiangqian’s maneuver to drag the Yang family into the water was not exactly glorious, it had undeniably dragged down the various families of Gu Prefecture, who were already clumsy in their support. Li Zhouwei was determined to obtain that fragment.  It was only for the Yang family's benefit that he had spoken a few words of blame. Now, he turned his head and ordered.

"There are too many eyes and ears. Go down and tidy up first..."

Li Jiangqian understood his meaning and hurriedly led the cultivators toward the two passes. Only a few people remained in the air. Yu Xixin felt quite emotional; he lowered his head to offer congratulations, his gaze still fixed on the shimmering light of Converging Water beneath the Heavenly Gate.

Li Zhouwei took a pill from Li Ximing's hand and swallowed it, temporarily using his divine ability to suppress his injuries so his appearance returned to normal. Feeling his dharma power surging rapidly, his gaze fell upon Yu Xixin as he smiled.

"Rest assured, Daoist Master Yu, this King will not damage his foundation!"

Even though Gu You had spoken very harsh words earlier, he was still a figure from the grotto-heavens. Unlike Qiao Wenliu, he could be considered one of their own. Yu Xixin had to plead for him regardless, so he hurriedly cupped his hands and said,

"This old man thanks King Wei on his behalf!"

Li Ximing had not seen the entire process, but he understood eighty or ninety percent of it. Looking at the scene, he sighed and said,

"This Daoist Master Gu... is actually so arrogant!"

Yu Xixin felt this most deeply. Hearing these words, he finally sighed.

"Friend Zhaojing does not know. This person was born in the 'Bu Zao Tian' and grew up inside the Grotto-Heaven. I have never asked about his ancestors, but they are likely related to the Longkang clan, and he was determined from the start to be the first among his generation. Once he achieved Converging Water, he became increasingly arrogant, competing in everything."

Li Ximing's brows furrowed instantly, listening as Yu Xixin lamented,

"After all, it is Converging Water, a path of severance. Without madness and arrogance, one cannot achieve great things..."

Li Zhouwei seemed lost in thought, while Li Ximing asked, "What is the meaning of this?"

Yu Xixin had read the Daoist scriptures thoroughly and saw things clearly, saying only,

"Converging Water lies in the Dragon. This has not changed for countless years and should not have been sought. However, rumors of the True Dragon descending to the world spread within the Grotto-Heavens centuries ago. The old Daoist Master who guided Daoist Master Gu to cultivate Converging Water knew there was only one path: to wait for the True Dragon incident and seize the position through the momentum. Success means success; failure means death..."

"Consequently, he harbored the ambition to gather the strengths of various families and synthesize them into a single Dao of his own. Within the Grotto-Heaven, he visited various peaks, duelling in spell arts and debating scriptures, never resting for a day, like a plague god. None of the other cultivators were fond of him... When he ventured out, he fought King Dai, fought King Chen, Wei Xuanyin, Murong Weidian, and even those Great Mahas... he battled them all... He was injured several times... almost falling on the spot!"

"Although I am not familiar with him, Fellow Daoist Shangguan cherished his talents and once mentioned to me..."

He said faintly,

"Gu You claims not to fear death—if there is even a single thought of falling short, contending for the position of Converging Water is certain death. Since death is inevitable either way, only by carving out a bloody path is there a possibility of achieving the Dao one day. If his spirit breaks before anyone, then he dies a mediocrity."

"Those of us who came out of the Grotto-Heavens all have our own needs. He... I fear more than half of his intent was specifically to seek King Wei!"

Li Ximing was struck dumb for a moment, then shook his head and said,

"True enough. To covet the Dragon's Converging Water is already the height of arrogance..."

Li Zhouwei nodded, seemingly having guessed this long ago, and praised,

"This man truly has ability! The might of Prophecy at Hand is not inferior to the Crimson Severing Arrowhead!"

He was deep in thought.

Only he knew how passive the situation had been when that Prophecy at Hand transformed into Pristine Water from the Converging Water divine ability. It looked as if he had won in one drumbeat, but the key to this battle lay not in Imperial Observation of the Origin', but in the [Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method] suppressing the Pristine Water transformation of Prophecy at Hand!

This method displayed an unexpected wondrous effect in restricting the Converging Water divine ability, causing Daoist Master Gu to pause for several breaths. Li Zhouwei's ability to seize tactical opportunities was formidable. Not hesitating to trade injury for injury, he struck with Crimson Severing Arrowhead and captured him with Imperial Observation of the Origin. Yet even so, he had almost let this Daoist Master Gu rush out!

'It seems that against certain Pristine-Converging transformations in the future, [Southern Emperor's Profound Snare Method] will have marvelous uses...'

But leaving this Daoist Master Gu aside, Yu Xixin's words also held deep meaning.

What did he mean by 'Those of us who came out of the Grotto-Heavens all have our own needs'? If his stance had not been obvious before, his intentions were now clear as day.

Yu Xixin was a Purple Qi Great Daoist Master!

True Purple was originally one lineage, circulated within the mountains of the True Dao Sect. In the world today, who held the True Qi? Why did the Martial Cultivation Star in the sky shine? His words spoke of Gu You, but outside his words, he was secretly pointing toward that Emperor Song in the south!

Li Zhouwei swept a glance at him.

'He probably doesn't harbor thoughts of seeking Purple Qi. What does this mean... is he trying to gain enlightment of Holder of the Profound, waiting for Emperor Song to achieve the Dao, and giving him a next life?'

Regardless, as the only Great Daoist Master currently under his command, Yu Xixin obviously had a different stance from the cultivators of Chun City. This made Li Zhouwei secretly frown.

'Longkang Yao... went south and did not return. Could it be he also had some thoughts of helping him succeed...'

He did not answer this person's chatter. He simply glanced at the magnificently standing Heavenly Gate, touched his sleeve, and took out the Heavenly Nurture Urn.

This Spiritual Treasure was currently shining brightly, its entire body flickering with radiant patterns, causing Yu Xixin's eyelids to jump.

"Wen Daoping—does Daoist Master Yu recognize him?", said Li Zhouwei.

Yu Xixin, of course, knew of this old Daoist Master Wen, and he also knew about the affair of the old man putting on airs in front of Li Zhouwei. The mention of him now brought an unavoidable bitterness to his tone as he replied.

"I recognize him..."

Li Zhouwei sneered.

"He stays comfortably in my Spiritual Treasure; I actually find him taking up space!"

As soon as the voice fell, the Spiritual Treasure spun rapidly, spewing out boiling azure light. As this azure light continuously gathered in front, it took on a human shape. An aged voice coughed incessantly, gnashing teeth:

"Li..."

But the voice sounded for only that single instant before a golden scripture scroll smashed down heavily, causing him to spurt a mouthful of blood and fall silent. Yu Xixin did not hesitate for a second to suppress him beneath the Spiritual Treasure. He formed a divine ability, put the item away, and said in a low voice.

"Wen Daoping is arrogant and conceited... Please..."

Li Zhouwei did not care about this old Daoist Master. He waved his hand, raised his hand solemnly, and aimed the Spiritual Treasure at the Converging Water. Edict Spirit activated, his entire body's divine ability and dharma power surging!

[Store and Combine]!

Thousands of binding lights spewed forth. Under the Heavenly Gate, the light of Converging Water, heavy as a thousand catties, began to move slowly, falling bit by bit toward the mouth of the urn.

Gu You was already a Great Daoist Master. With the weight of four divine abilities, even Li Zhouwei's Imperial Observation of the Origin could not imprison him for long, let alone this Spiritual Treasure. However, the [Store and Combine] of the Heavenly Nurture Urn most restrained Water virtue. This Great Daoist Master was already heavily injured; with one side waning and the other waxing, this point of Converging Water light fell slowly and was actually gradually collected into the urn.

Even so, the urn shook violently in an instant. Inside were no longer distinct grains, but a pool of boiling, ceaseless Converging Water, constantly surging from within, attempting to kill its way out. Li Zhouwei threw the Huai River Map into it and circulated his divine ability to suppress it before it slowly stabilized.

Aside from the golden shuttle he had collected, only that small black flag remained. Li Zhouwei summoned it for a look. It turned out to be a good treasure as well. It should have caused considerable trouble, but it had merely been suppressed by the Huai River Map.

'Although the miracles of this Huai River Map are not astonishing, its value lies in the handwriting of the True Monarch. As long as it is deployed, it can always suppress the Spiritual Treasures of others, effectively breaking one of the enemy's arms. It truly meets strength with strength.'

Li Zhouwei temporarily suppressed and stored it, not letting down his guard. His spiritual consciousness remained on the Spiritual Treasure in his hand. After a slight calculation, he shook his head secretly.

'This man's [Where Currents Return] is formidable. As time passes, constantly agitating his divine ability and dharma power... although it is contained now, within three days, the Converging Water will nourish itself daily and will definitely rush out of this urn!'

Three days was not considered ample time. Li Zhouwei felt a slight regret in his heart:

'After all, he is a Great Daoist Master... killing him is too difficult and too much of a pity. Even if he cannot be subdued, exchanging him for benefits would not be bad... Only as a last resort will I perform the act of killing... For now, I have a good aid.'

He calculated secretly. While he suppressed this Great Daoist Master, Li Ximing chatted quite agreeably with Yu Xixin. Li Ximing had interacted much with Tinglan, who was different from this Great Daoist Master, representing another faction of Purple Qi, so they actually ended up discussing the transformations of Purple Qi.

Seeing Li Zhouwei looking over, Yu Xixin hurriedly turned around. King Wei had already sent the urn over, saying,

"Daoist Master Yu is proficient in spell arts and deeply understands the matters of the Immortal Dao. The suppression of Converging Water... is left to the Master."

Yu Xixin knew this was an offending task, but there was no turning back now. He accepted it lightly, pinching the 'Chapter on Arranging Purple' divine ability. He tapped lightly on the urn a few times, gaining a reaction, and quickly unlocked it with his Dao-Profundity, saying,

"This is easy to handle. Although Daoist Master Gu is Converging Water, his divine ability is not full. He lacks the All-Leveling Sage. This 'Leveling' refers to the leveling of water; nothing in the world is more level than water. Without All-Leveling Sage, he cannot level the various waters. We only need to inject Valley Water inside. Where Currents Return is all-encompassing; it will definitely dye the Converging with the Valley. Then, by extracting his divine ability and combining it with the intent of collection and storage, we should be able to keep him from coming out for ten days or so."

This Purple Qi cultivator was meant to sit behind the scenes, resolving doubts and elucidating profundity. Within a few words, the ingenuity of combining his divine ability and Dao-Profundity was evident. Thus, he pinched a divine ability, opened a small mouth in the Heavenly Nurture Urn to mobilize the Converging Water out, and took a Spiritual Artifact himself, preparing to supplement it with Valley Water, reminding,

"Only... since Valley Water is entering, I fear it will cause Daoist Master Gu's injuries to heal a bit faster."

"No matter!"

Li Zhouwei did not care. If they eventually attacked Chun City, being able to use the compromise of Gu Prefecture to suppress this person, having his injuries heal faster might actually be a good thing.

After waiting for a moment, a man was seen speeding out from the south, dressed in purple-black official robes, his golden eyes burning. He was born extremely refined and elegant, but his face was full of anxiety. Seeing the group from afar, he hurriedly stepped forward, performed a salute, and said,

"Father!"

This person was none other than Li Jiangliang!

This golden-eyed one had used Holder of the Profound to achieve the Purple Mansion Realm. It was the time of his spring breeze of success, and having been fighting battles outside, his temperament was distinctly different, causing Li Ximing to hurriedly welcome him and take his hand.

Li Zhouwei raised his brows and smiled, "Congratulations!"

"I dare not..."

Hearing this word, the anxiety on Li Jiangliang's face was broken slightly. He hurriedly returned the salute respectfully, looked at Yu Xixin on the side, hesitated to speak, then turned to Li Ximing and said,

"The two passes are greatly broken. The road to Chun City is now wide open... Does My Lord have any new orders?"

Li Ximing was stunned and said, "What is this..."

Li Jiangliang's voice lowered, suppressing his divine ability, and said, "Just now... this junior met Daoist Master Jia rushing from the south. He had only set off a few days ago, but when passing over the lake, he was intercepted by Eldest Sister..."

"Quewan?! On the lake?"

Li Ximing became suddenly suspicious in his heart—Li Quewan had her own communication with them. If anything happened on the lake, she only needed to crush a jade talisman to give a warning. How did it come to letting Jia Zan, an outsider, bring a message!

Li Jiangliang's eyes turned red instantly. He nodded heavily and said,

'Eldest Sister entrusted him to bring a message to the two elders, asking how the handling of matters in the north is going. If King Wei has no opportunity to return home... could you, elder, please make a trip back...'

'The Old Master... is already in a very bad state.'

Li Ximing froze in mid-air instantly, those eyes staring straight at the junior before him, his heart shaking greatly.

'In a very bad state?'

'That's right...'

Li Xuanxuan!

When Li Ximing set off from the lake, he had examined Li Xuanxuan's body. in this aspect, he was far inferior to Li Quewan. The woman had said long ago that he probably wouldn't last through this year...

But he had not expected it to come so quickly!

The fragment appeared in the world, and the Talisman Seeds all sensed it. Whether Li Xuanxuan or Li Quewan, even far away on the lake, they would inevitably have sensed it. The old man would absolutely not delay this matter. Even if Li Quewan saw that the old man's body was unwell, she would not dare to casually crush the jade talisman and cause the matters of the north to be abandoned entirely!

'That is why she found Jia Zan to pass the word...'

Li Ximing stood dazed on the spot, saying in disbelief,

"When did this happen? How much longer? Didn't they say there were still many days!"

Li Jiangliang said sorrowfully, "It has already been some days. I fear less than ten days remain. Eldest Sister said... his life force was already about to sever, and yet he sat kneeling without rising, his emotions fluctuating, at times sad and at times joyful; naturally, he cannot last long."

Li Zhouwei also heard clearly. There was not a trace of hesitation in his eyes. After thinking slightly, he said,

"Since that is the case, Granduncle, hurry back at once!"
