# Chapter 1296: Coiled

These figures stood tall, spanning heaven and earth. Unlike the sight of the Five Monarchs observing the gu-vessel at Green Pine Temple back then, they were scattered, some far and some near, like an infinite range of mountains standing at the horizon. From a vantage point beyond the sight of any divine ability, they emanated limitless might.

Lu Jiangxian watched in silence.

Closest to this grotto-heaven was a pitch-black figure that towered from the earth to the sky, occupying more than half of the celestial curtain. Its eyes were like two massive stars flickering in the heavens, its vertical pupils like two black rifts spanning heaven and earth, gushing forth an endless torrent of water.

His enormous figure was wrapped in something that stretched endless and boundless, shimmering with pitch-black scales that seemed to slide across his body. Its sheer size created a dizzying distortion, like the displacement of stars.

'So familiar...'

In all the world, there were few serpent-or-dragon-shaped things that a True Monarch could carry on their back. Lu Jiangxian had once borrowed Li Xuanfeng's eyes to witness the great battle in the Northern Sea where a Dragon Monarch had intervened. That heaven-spanning, black-scaled figure looked extremely similar to the thing coiled around this being!

'That is a Hornless Dragon, one of the nine sons.'

Yet the information Lu Jiangxian had gathered from various sources was consistent. Only two Dragon Monarchs remained in the world. Neither of them could possibly come to the mainland, and Dragon Monarch Xiyang did not possess such an intense aura of Water Virtue. The answer was perfectly clear.

'That Hornless Dragon is not His true body, but His...'

'Achievement!'

This colossal figure, filling half the sky, actually dared to carry the corpse of one of the nine sons on his back to display the achievement of his own attainment of the Dao!

'This is a Pit Water True Monarch. Most likely... He holds an Intercalary Position.'

The marvelous power radiating from him was palpable, threatening to swallow the entire Great Tomb River. Clearly, this place was his domain.

'Perhaps it isn't a clear division of strength, but rather that this place was always meant to be his to command, whether by the tide of fate or by a clear demarcation of Daoist tradition and lineage...'

A trace of complex emotion flickered in Lu Jiangxian's eyes.

'He guessed correctly...'

'There truly is a Pit Water True Monarch of Intercalary Position waiting for him in the Great Tomb River.'

The look in his eyes was complicated.

'And the Dragon-kin... they cooperate with Him so readily. Even though this True Monarch wears one of the nine sons, they do not care.'

He stared at the scene in the sky, a sight that would make any cultivator with divine abilities tremble. His heart grew heavier, and his gaze finally shifted from this being to the other side.

In the sky hung a comet, as large as the sun.

'Profound Chaos Dark World Feng Yue True Monarch—Taiyue.'

His appearance was not surprising. Before that comet stood a figure in black robes, his garments billowing. He looked ancient, yet his eyes were as dark and deep as ink.

'Yang Tianya...'

'Or perhaps... Yang Jinxin.'

This battle-scarred judge of the Underworld stood upon the void, his gaze sharp, as if waiting for something.

The auras in the sky were indistinct, implying more powers were lurking in concealment. Lu Jiangxian watched grimly, thinking to himself,

'This is truly too difficult... No wonder the Underworld is unwilling to intervene, even for such a prime opportunity. The only good news is that, so far, I haven't seen anyone from Luoxia arrive.'

The white-robed man wandered between heaven and earth for a time, his somewhat unsettled gaze drifting north. Finally, a trace of confusion surfaced.

'Xuan Cang hasn't made his move...'

Although Lu Jiangxian was extremely far from the north and could not see the changes there clearly, if Xuan Cang were to act according to his agreement with Xiao Chuting, it would be no small affair—it would be a battle between True Monarchs.

'For these beings to be here so at ease, the ones holding him back in the Northern Sea must be the two from the Dragon-kin.'

Back then, a few True Monarchs fighting could tear the heavens asunder. If the current Xuan Cang believes he can stall several opponents, or even counts on winning, the resulting commotion will surely be immense. The moment he moves, the entire world will know.

'Besides... what strange art does He possess that allows him to 'borrow' the Boundless Ocean? What catalyst is he waiting for?'

...

As water rose and clouds fell across the world, Li Jiangqian fled into the distance, rushing ahead single-mindedly. In just a moment, he saw the aquatic region ahead tremble violently. Profound Yellow Qi flashed, and colors bloomed everywhere like flowers.

He composed himself slightly, pretending to be unconcerned as he moved forward, while simultaneously activating Spirit Probe to look, his heart pounding in alarm.

He saw a dark light surging through the water, like a shuttle crossing the sky, recklessly burning its divine ability and dharma power to race onward. Behind it floated an extremely bizarre streak of color.

This color was neither light nor shadow, neither wind nor mist. It resembled a twisting, serpentine cloud, weaving through the riverbed at extreme speed, parting the currents and condensing an intensely powerful pressure.

Under the gaze of Spirit Probe, the cloud impressively coalesced into a human form. When Li Jiangqian saw the face and robes, and considered the unlucky soul being chased, he mostly understood.

'It's Dongfang Heyun!'

This wisp of soaring cloud, born from the Dragon Monarch's own attainment of the Dao, was renowned. He had interacted with several generations of the Li family, so Li Jiangqian naturally knew his reputation. His heart sank.

'His lifespan is vast. He has been a subordinate to several generations of Dragon Princes. Back when the waters fell and the thunder rose, he rode the winds to ascend, and his relationship with the Dragon Monarch became extremely close...'

His current aura didn't reveal any obvious divine ability, but Li Jiangqian understood that in this day and age, the only one who could compare to him was likely Suiguan, who had ventured out from the Pristine Speech Heaven.

'No wonder Touba Ci is fleeing for his life...'

Touba Ci was certainly a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Touba family, and an outstanding one among his peers, but forget him—even his backer, Touba Qiye, would have no choice but to flee if he ran into this powerhouse.

Li Jiangqian watched with malicious glee as the two ran circles around a few palaces, only disappearing from view as he moved away. He then darted through the water, seizing the opportunity to descend swiftly upon another palace complex.

This place was clearly much smaller than the previous cluster, yet it looked newer. Not far away was an acquaintance in green robes, clutching a gourd and looking extremely cautious. It was Sima Yuanli.

Li Jiangqian smiled to himself. His goal was clear, so he ignored him and stepped directly into the main hall. He spent some time disabling the grand formation before forcing the doors open.

The hall was adorned with circular, black-and-white murals. All around were ceremonial tables, deep blue etched with golden patterns. The pool water was clear, and several jade-green side-hall entrances were set between the murals, making Li Jiangqian nod to himself.

'Besides the usual implements for storing Pristine Water in the spirit pool... this place is seventy percent similar to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion in the Eastern Sea!'

This was, of course, the reason Li Jiangqian had chosen to enter this place. He rushed in without hesitation, plundered the various side halls, and quickly emerged, weighing three jade boxes in his hand.

'Three spiritual resources.'

Ten years ago, such a haul would have been substantial, but the dazzling riches of Luoxia had spoiled him. He found this harvest merely average. The one or two cultivation manuals in his sleeve, however, were decent.

'The West Gorge Enters Sea Scripture for achieving Position Follows Peril and the Heavy Clouds No Rain Scripture for Darkening Clouds... It's rare that both include a qi-gathering art and two secret techniques. They might be useful...'

His gaze swept the room once more before he reached behind the main seat and retrieved a jade vial.

The vial was two fingers wide, pale blue, and richly fragrant. It shattered under his grip, releasing a pale blue stream of water that flowed down, causing Li Jiangqian's eyebrows to raise in surprise. A hint of satisfaction finally touched his features.

'A portion of Pit Water!'

This was Emblem Fragrance Pit Water, known in ancient times as Emblem Fragrance Moistening the Mounded Marsh. Li Jiangqian had heard of it; it was exceedingly rare and long thought to have vanished.

'When this water flows, it can nourish skeletal remains, making them appear as they did in life. It emits a rich fragrance that entrances the soul. If any cultivator below the divine ability level encounters it, they will instantly lose their senses, becoming muddled and lost, intoxicated by myriad illusions, unable to break free.'

In ancient times, when a cultivator with divine abilities discovered this water, they often found the area surrounded by kneeling, low-level cultivators who had stumbled upon it, frozen in states of extreme avarice. The water, nourishing their remains, would keep them perfectly preserved, their complexions rosy and astonishingly lifelike.

Li Jiangqian, however, made a mental note.

'The Whole Pill can balance Pit and Radiant. Many secret arts use these two principles. If I take this spiritual water back to my sister, it will surely be useful.'

He instantly stored it in his sleeve, only then putting on a display of alertness, shouting lowly,

"Who!"

After a moment's pause, the green-robed Daoist Master appeared, looking greatly relieved. He bowed repeatedly and smiled.

"Young Master!"

"So it's Senior Qinghu."

Li Jiangqian sighed in relief and smiled.

"It seems you were one step too late!"

Sima Yuanli, however, felt no regret. He even felt somewhat lucky, sighing in relief inwardly.

'It's just as well... There's nothing for me to gain in this grotto-heaven, and that green-eyed ghost won't come looking for me...'

Sima Yuanli had been robbed of a Spiritual Treasure by Chi Buzi years ago. Knowing he had to come to the Great Tomb River, he had been terrified upon entering the hall and seeing another pool of Pristine Water.

Still shaken, he sighed and said,

"Young Master, you may not know, but on my way here, I saw that monk Kongshu fighting fiercely with a Great Daoist Master. I was nearly caught in the crossfire! It frightened me so much I didn't dare linger and immediately dove down here."

'Kongshu...'

Li Jiangqian motioned for him to keep moving. As the two flew out of the palace complex together, he asked,

"How skilled is this monk?"

"Extremely!"

Sima Yuanli's expression was grave as he said,

"The one fighting him should be Daoist Master Valley Water from the Yan State. Although Valley Water cultivators don't excel at combat, he's from the Murong family, so his skills are definitely not weak. Yet, he was being completely suppressed by that monk... You must be careful!"

"I overheard them fighting about something called the Judgement Prison. The monk was demanding its whereabouts, tangling with the Daoist Master. A dignified Great Daoist Master of Valley Water, and he was completely tied down by him."

Li Jiangqian grew thoughtful and said,

"Judgement Prison?"

Sima Yuanli lowered his voice.

"This monk is a major figure from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. He rarely intervenes in worldly affairs and is known for his purity and lack of desire. For even him to personally take action, lowering himself to search for such a place, it must be extremely important. The Way of Great Desire and the Compassion Dao... they are likely here for the very same purpose."

Li Jiangqian nodded, deep in thought, and made a mental note.

'I have Spirit Probe and can see for a thousand li, which makes searching easier. But since this place is coveted by all the Buddhists, any fight over it will likely be at the Great Daoist Master level. It's best if I don't get involved...'

He was still weighing his options when the green-robed Daoist Master before him hesitated a moment, then asked,

"King Wei..."

Clearly, Sima Yuanli had not seen Li Zhouwei at all before entering the grotto-heaven and was now suspicious. Li Jiangqian sighed.

"I don't know either... If Father came, he must have entered with my sister. I have no idea where they've been scattered to."

He probed subtly for a while, observing the man's behavior, and quickly came to a realization.

'Every family has its own connections. His Sima Family was like a fish in water in Anhuai Heaven and knew Wanling Heaven like the back of their hand, but here, they are completely blind...'

Li Jiangqian had Spirit Probe. He could see opportunities clearly and avoid dangers. There was no need to travel with Sima Yuanli, which would mean sharing treasures and likely arousing his suspicion. His brow furrowed, and he said,

"I just saw Dongfang Heyun hunting people down. Thankfully, Touba Ci was there to be unlucky first, which allowed me to escape. We should each pick a direction and get away from here, quickly!"

Sima Yuanli was horrified. Before he could ask any questions, Li Jiangqian had already left him far behind. He hadn't traveled more than a few dozen li before his senses suddenly went on high alert.

In the distance, someone was approaching at high speed, their form an interweaving of light and shadow, trailing a thick, ink-green aura of wood qi.

'Daoist Master Shen Sou, of the Sun family.'

Talk about a small world. Although this Daoist Master wasn't from a murderous, all-powerful Daoist tradition, he was still a Daoist Master with three divine abilities. Li Jiangqian was already at a disadvantage in this grotto-heaven, so he naturally moved to avoid him, spotting two palaces below and immediately descending.

Aided by Spirit Probe, he had seen traces of others from a distance, but he still feigned stopping. As expected, they were completely empty. He inwardly shook his head.

'The Great Tomb River isn't like Wanling Heaven. There are far too many people whose ancestors came from here, or who had connections to the Chen family of old... They're looting everything very quickly.'

A thought flickered in his mind. He watched Daoist Master Shen Sou, who was moving with clear purpose, periodically pulling out a jade talisman to take a reading, and he immediately had a theory.

'In this grotto-heaven, even the Great Void has vanished and spiritual sense is limited. What could he possibly be sensing? I heard Western Shu has a Heaven-Governing treasure... It must be that!'

He thus followed the clusters of palaces, rising and falling, tracing the lay of the land forward. Before long, he saw the terrain rise in the distance. The pure-black riverbed arched upward like a mountain, and divine abilities vibrated from that location. It seemed many cultivators were fighting there incessantly.

The range of Li Jiangqian's Spirit Probe was terrifyingly vast. While Shen Sou was still stopping and starting, constantly taking readings, Li Jiangqian could already see his final destination. He activated his divine ability, riding the current straight ahead, his mind racing.

'That main hall is also a bright jade palace, likely similar to the place Dongfang Heyun just emerged from, but there are many cultivators there... A perfect opportunity to fish in troubled waters!'

More importantly, his Spirit Probe vaguely detected another color lurking among the powers, one seemingly blessed by the Supreme Yin, yet tinged with the color of mercury. Who else could that be but his sister?

'We were scattered upon entering the grotto-heaven. She must have separated from Father. One, I can ask her for news of him. Two... with her Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, she can come and go as she pleases!'

Li Jiangqian's golden eyes flickered, a faint smile playing on his lips.

'She isn't greedy like I am. With her cautious personality, for her to be willing to stay in such a chaotic place, there must be a worthwhile treasure or opportunity. I absolutely have to go!'
