# Chapter 1342: Another Scheme

"Cough, cough... cough, cough..."

The cave dwelling was secluded and silent, yet the sound of coughing rang out abruptly. Above on the jade bed, a young man leaned on his side, his hand propped against the front of the couch. Facing the ground, he coughed violently.

"Ugh..."

After a good long while, he fiercely spat out a mouthful of blood. It splattered onto the stone floor, unexpectedly eroding it into large and small pits. Silver light flowed like water ripples, seemingly still reflecting clusters of dancing flames.

Rolling Radiant Fire burned within his heart. That golden eye seemed to still be staring straight at him in the pitch-black great hall, overflowing with hatred.

"Still deceiving me!"

Only at this moment did that thunderous voice fade away. Li Suining finally came back to his senses. A layer of cold sweat instantly broke out over his entire body. It was as if his body had separated from his clothes, having abruptly thinned a full circle, soaked in a deep chill.

Yet he felt as though he were still amidst those raging flames. The pungent smell and the sensation of being scorched by Radiant Fire still danced within his spiritual consciousness, causing him unbearable agony as he gasped for breath in great heaves.

'The Southern Brightness Heart-Fire at that time... was truly too terrifying...'

The young man sat on the couch for a very, very long time before he caught his breath. He moved down from the jade bed, leaning against the bedside. Looking around his surroundings, a sense of carefree relief from surviving a catastrophe rose in his heart, and he could not help but smile bitterly.

'In this life... I suppose I have wronged him.'

The Heavenly Element backtracking had no warning. Li Suining could not guarantee whether what he experienced was merely the Heavenly Element or the final life. He could only treat every instance as the last, giving his all—whether preparing a path of retreat or seeking Bright Yang. At the same time, he treated every instance as a Heavenly Element backtracking, attempting to dig out a bit more information at the final moment...

Therefore, he absolutely could not let Daoist Master Changli defect to the Buddhists!

He, Li Suining, could not gamble on whether Daoist Master Changli would retain his original heart after defecting to the Buddhists. If the one who returned was Daoist Master Changli, death would only claim Li Suining alone, but what if the one who returned was Maha Changli?

He coughed twice more. His body, which should have been full of vigor from long periods of quiet cultivation, was currently exhausted beyond measure. It was as if he had not been in secluded cultivation for this past year, but wandering between life and death, constantly fighting and struggling with ruthless ferocity...

Yet Li Suining was not distracted in the slightest. Having recovered some strength, he stood up with high spirits, walked to the desk, and picked up a bamboo brush. He looked at the map spread out on the table surface, yet delayed putting pen to paper for a long time.

Li Suining's five fingers clenched tighter and tighter, causing the bamboo brush to explode with a *crack*, yet he seemed unaware of it, grinding his teeth.

"Liang Jushi... Qiu Wanyi... and those stinking monks..."

But these various thoughts were suddenly interrupted in his mind, transforming into a field of clarity.

"At this time... King Wei is at... the two passes of Yun and Pu..."

He knew what would happen next.

The two passes would be breached, and Longkang Yao of Mount Rao in the south would also be defeated and retreat. The final gateway would be lost, leaving Chun City's empty gates wide open... Yet this Great Daoist Master of the Longkang Clan could be said to be stubborn to the extreme. He would still gather manpower and go to war, reportedly employing connections from within the grotto-heavens.

But Li Jiangqian had once mentioned that it was not necessarily connections from the grotto-heavens:

'After this matter, there will inevitably be the so-called shadow of Dongmu!'

Regardless of who it was, one person came out from the grotto-heavens, surnamed Fu, named Tanjian. This person possessed high divine abilities and extremely powerful Spiritual Treasures. He joined forces with Longkang Yao and held fast without coming out!

Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangqian naturally could not give up. They feigned a withdrawal to set a trap and lure them out. Just as they had managed to trap Fu Tanjian with great difficulty, Thunder Chief of Mount Dayang intervened, causing their efforts to fall short at the last moment.

And within a few days, sudden changes occurred in the Shu lands. The Shu Emperor sent a secret edict out of the palace. The various Daoist Masters led by the Qiu Clan attacked the Great Desert, and the Sun Clan invaded Yuyang. The Song Dynasty's western front was in critical condition, forcing Yang Ruiyi and even Li Ximing to return to provide aid.

'If there was still a possibility of maneuvering before, the participation of Western Shu was like a thousand-jun heavy hammer, rendering the plans in the north completely void.'

The situation took a sharp turn for the worse. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm finally finished dealing with Great Tomb River. Once Yang Ruiyi left, they intervened from the rear. Fu Tanjian also took the opportunity to invade. Relying on Li Zhouwei's ingenious troop deployment, they held fast for several months. Fighting one against many at the two passes, he created an excellent opportunity and instead defeated both sides...

This King Wei finally fought his way into Chun City. Almost on the same day, the celestial phenomena in the east changed drastically, and another person unexpectedly stepped forward—a cultivator from Gu Prefecture whom everyone had cast to the back of their minds for years.

Jiang Yan!

He actually achieved the status of Great Daoist Master at this moment, coming to provide support, stabilizing the routing cultivators, and secretly withdrawing. Li Zhouwei, fighting one against many, was already heavily injured. Even if he had ten thousand unwillingnesses at this moment, he could only sigh that the time was not on his side and retreat from Chun City with extreme speed.

'Looking at it this way, there must be something fishy about this matter!'

According to the scene back then, Jiang Yan went into seclusion to break through during the campaign of Luoxia... Once he failed, his immortal foundation was ruined, and repairing it would take at least five years!

'The time is absolutely wrong... A scheme has already been laid out for the Jiang clan. Calculating it this way, it must be that a treasure was bestowed, allowing him to step past the Purple Mystery. He should have emerged during the Great Tomb River upheavel to resist King Wei, but because the Earth Virtue is difficult to achieve, he stayed in seclusion for a few more days. Thus, it dragged on until later. Only when turmoil struck Chun City did he have no choice but to come out.'

At this moment, Jiang Yan wanted to advance his troops, but Fu Tanjian had long since been beaten into fear. In the end, he watched King Wei leave. By the time the various cultivators retreated to Luoxia, bad news arrived from another location.

Guyan had been breached!

'Thinking about it now, King Wei should not have attacked Chun City back then... He merely went in to plunder once before having to withdraw, but the price for this trip was incomparably high...'

Qing Jifang was in closed-door cultivation. Without him, Western Shu's morale was simply greatly boosted. Several Great Daoist Masters intervened one after another, and with the assistance of Heavenly Element, the Great Daoist Master of the Sun Clan came north ahead of schedule. Most of the manpower was in the north; Yang Ruiyi could not save them in time, actually allowing Lin Chensheng to perish on the spot!

Li Suining's mood sank.

'After Guyan fell, Shu and Song redrew their borders... Fortunately, King Wei rushed back to relieve the siege...'

But with Li Zhouwei leaving like this, the situation in the north, which had just become clear with great difficulty, naturally fell into ruin. It just so happened that at this time, the Peacock of the Way of Great Desire exited seclusion—[Misheng's Reincarnation]!

Although there was less interference from the Compassion Dao, the impact caused was no smaller than the Changhe Rebellion of the previous life. This Peacock constantly expanded the territory of the Way of Great Desire, occupying the conquered Zhao lands with justifiable reasoning. How could Yu Xixin and the others be opponents? They were defeated again and again, leaving only the two passes of Yun and Pu, surrendering all other lands. Everything turned to naught in the blink of an eye.

Fortunately, Jiang Yan and the others used their troops with surprising ingenuity. With the help of Longkang Yao, they clashed with the Way of Great Desire while reclaiming lost territory. They tore off all pretenses and fought in a chaotic brawl, which finally gave the various cultivators time to breathe, temporarily retreating back into the two passes...

"This great war... the casualties were more horrifying than ever before..."

By the time Li Zhouwei finished healing his injuries and returned to the north, the entire northern situation had stabilized. Under the repeated slaughter between Mount Dayang and Jiang Yan, the land was riddled with scars. The troops of King Wei were also all wounded. The difficulty this time was different from the past. Although Li Zhouwei relied on his own abilities to reintegrate the eastern cultivators and suppress the Buddhist cultivators, the result had completely changed.

'Wu Miao and Qiao Wenliu both perished. It wasn't just these figures with insufficient backgrounds, but even Jiang Fuwang, Bian Fan, Gu You, Tang Jiyu, Qi Lanjin... and finally even Jiang Yan. All these people fell one after another in this chaos that swept across the eight directions, where the Buddhist cultivators played the oriole behind the mantis, leaving behind a land of misery and suffering...'

It was precisely because of this that Li Suining did not even mention their names before dying in his previous life. The only one who could hold the Great Desert for the Lake was Yu Xixin. At this moment, these bloody names floated before his eyes one by one, bringing clarity to his mind.

'Luoxia, Underworld, and the Dragons have already partitioned the world, treating this land as a chessboard for Bright Yang to gallop across. But it is not as if no great figures are intervening. There are still Dharma Aspects! There are still Buddhist cultivators!'

'Under the circumstance where They only care about whether King Wei can ultimately seek the Dao, the Buddhist cultivators will inevitably use any means necessary to stop King Wei. Thus came the former [Changhe Rebellion], and thus came the [Misheng's Reincarnation] of the previous life. If the former did not exist, the latter would. Fundamentally, they are the same matter!'

'It is these Dharma Aspects... harboring the deepest malice and the greatest disgust toward King Wei within the scope of what is controllable! It is secret revenge for all past events!'

'Only by jumping out of the chessboard can one see this point. These noble clans of Chun City thought they could profit from both sides, not wanting to offend us or others. Yet they never imagined that under the cooperation of the three powers, they had long been regarded by the Buddhist cultivators as the future foundation for Bright Yang. If they still do not attach themselves to King Wei, in the end, apart from a pool of blood, nothing will remain!'

Thinking of it now, Li Suining was full of emotion.

Why was it that when the fighting reached the Imperial Palace, the Yan Kingdom's ruler and ministers were united of one heart, guarding it dead fast? Aside from that unexpected Dongling Incident, the most important reason was that there were no capable people left under Li Zhouwei's command!

'After the stab in the back from Western Shu, the entire plan was disrupted. These Great Daoist Masters almost all perished... Even Longkang Yao was heartbroken to the point of vomiting blood, returning to the grotto-heaven to sit in meditation and pass away. Those by King Wei's side... were almost only these family retainers and Gao Fu who arrived later!'

Was there regret?

As far as Li Suining knew, this Great Daoist Master of Longkang was regretful in the end. He met King Wei once in Chun City. Li Suining had heard Li Ximing recount it. This Great Daoist Master regretted, yet was also resolute, leaving only this one sentence:

'[Longkang Yao's wish is merely to protect the city and guard the tradition!]'

In the eyes of this Great Daoist Master, he had always been guarding his hometown and his Dharma lineage. Whether it was Bright Yang or the various Buddhists, they were ultimately the descendants of True Monarchs. Some were willing to bow their heads, so naturally, there were others who were unwilling to bow.

But these words drifted away like the wind. Later, although Li Zhouwei possessed vast divine abilities and fought one against many, without the assistance of these people, his guarding of the entire Eastern Land was like patching a broken house leaking wind from all four sides. Every time he almost conquered the world's foremost pass, chaos would inevitably erupt from all directions...

And in the previous life, after the Wuchuan incident, Western Shu was even more like a runaway horse, repeatedly invading the borders.

'Only King Wei could hold it, and even inflict a crushing defeat on the Yan Kingdom. Had it been any other Great Daoist Master standing in that position, they would have long since vomited three liters of blood like Longkang Yao and washed their hands of the matter!'

That was why Li Suining was filled with endless regret in the final moments, feeling that in this life, even with his intervention, Li Zhouwei's presence was no broader than the before. In fact, compared to Li Zhouwei's own planning back then, there were quite a few places where it fell short...

Although there was the variable of Great Tomb River that influenced everything here, his, Li Suining's, own inability to influence the later stages was also a solid fact.

Now reborn, staring at this map densely packed with prefecture names, how could he not grind his teeth, hesitating with the brush raised, unaware that he had crushed the bamboo brush!

He stared straight at the map before him like this. Everything of the past seemed to transform into blood and slaughter, constantly wandering over the ancient map. Everything, absolutely everything, fell upon the thick black ink of [Chun City].

'But how should I contact King Wei now...'

Although this King Wei had left a talisman in his hand, everything in the north was far from something a warning talisman could solve. The matters involved here were too complex. A warning causing Li Zhouwei to hastily withdraw would create an adverse impact no smaller than leaving it alone!

'I fear I must first find... Daoist Master Suyun... I do not know if she has exited seclusion. I must win her trust... But if I let her pass the message, with the lake missing her guard, it is very likely we won't even survive the first wave of Western Shu's offensive!'

_Knock, knock!!_

However, a crisp knocking sound rang out at this moment. Li Suining was startled as if waking from a dream, his heart full of thoughts interrupted. He hurriedly went forward, only to see a person standing before the door. The man had regular features and a composed expression, his robes neat and clean. But the look on that face was extremely unsightly—pale and bloodless, yet possessing a sorrow so thick it could not dissolve.

Li Suining was dumbstruck.

"Brother!"

Li Suikuan raised his eyebrows to glance at him, his expression changing drastically.

"Your face..."

Li Suining’s heart was filled with complex emotions. In his previous life, Li Suikuan had fallen too early. When Guyan was lost, he had been submerged in the vast desert, to the point that when Li Suining saw him now, it felt as if a hundred years had passed in a daze. 

At this moment, he only said softly, "I performed some minor spell arts. There is no need for concern."

Li Suikuan could only lower his head, weeping as he spoke.

"The Old Master's days... are drawing near. Daoist Master Zhaojing is already rushing back from the north. I hear he will arrive at the mountain very soon. Lord asked me to come call you... to go pay our respects together!"

'Right!'

The news of Li Xuanxuan seemed to come from layers of history books, startling him into sudden wakefulness. Remembering the final face of this kind elder, he could not help but want to shed tears.

But this news was also like a spark, igniting all his thoughts.

'Daoist Master Zhaojing is already rushing back!'

His heart was both joyful and anxious, feeling only a rush of heat surging to the top of his head.

'Right... Right... After handling the Old Master's funeral, he will have to rush back to the north immediately. It could not be more suitable...'

In the darkness, it was actually this old man's death that made one last contribution to the Li Clan. For some reason, Li Suining’s eyes filled with tears as he stared blankly at his younger brother.

Upon hearing this kind of news, sorrow was naturally no issue. Li Suikuan gazed at him, also wiping tears from his face. This elder brother, however, pressed down on his shoulder, murmuring,

"You go first... You go first... Allow me to come a moment later..."

"Elder Brother, restrain your grief..."

Li Suikuan wiped his tears with the back of his hand. It seemed he had others to notify, so he hurriedly went down. The youth in silver robes turned around in a daze, hurriedly striding to the desk. He spread out the bamboo slips, lifted the ink brush, his heart thundering.

'I cannot delay for even a moment... Guyan cannot be lost, and Chun City cannot be let off lightly either. I must remind King Wei. The coming changes will be swift and sudden; a moment's delay brings a moment of trouble!'
