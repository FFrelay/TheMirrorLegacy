# Chapter 1329: Responding to Change

The whistle of wind echoed through the Great Void as streaks of multicolored divine abilities sped past. Soon, the vague shadow of the mortal world came into view, revealing endless earth veins stretching forward with cities distributed along them across the land.

The prefecture city below was called Chefu, a sprawling and unbroken behemoth. It did not seem particularly remarkable, and its Purple Mansion Realm grand array was weak, yet it faintly connected to the Great Void, appearing to possess a rather unique and wondrous quality.

Looking up to the north, one could see six pillars of light reaching for the heavens within the Yan Kingdom's borders, extending like a great wall that sealed the entire region off completely.

A sinister light flickered for a moment, revealing an old face. His gaze shifted, heavy with doubt, and seeming to notice King Wei's line of sight, Wu Miao spoke in a low voice,

"King Wei, this is the Chefu Prefecture cluster. To the north are the Six Cities of Youfang."

He said:

"Back then... when Zhao and Yan were at a standoff and the situation was unstable, the noble families of Chun City, fearing a southern invasion by the Yan Kingdom, recommended the Longkang clan's Daoist Master, Longkang Youfang, to come here. He built six consecutive cities, stretching like a dragon, to resist the people of Yan..."

"But later, Great Zhao fell into civil war and the border defenses were lost for a time. These six cities were handed over to the Yan Kingdom and now stand on the horizon..."

He did not seem regretful, but instead smiled and said,

"It's fortunate they were lost. Otherwise, it would be quite difficult for us to pass through here..."

Qiao Wenliu looked up and said casually, "After the Six Cities of Youfang were lost, the border was plagued by unrest, so Chun City sent the Pang clan's Daoist Master Pang Zhan. He built the Chefu Prefectures using the 'Boundless Water and Fire' from True Qi, linking all the arrays to suppress the Great Void..."

"In this way, if Buddhist cultivators were to head south, they would be constrained. When the grand array is active, even Immortal cultivators passing through who wish to remain undetected must slow to a crawl..."

"A rare sight indeed."

Li Zhouwei had some understanding of this before he arrived, though he was unaware of the history. He slowly withdrew his gaze, offering no comment.

'The Yan Kingdom has grown considerably strong after all these years of development. These six cities hold the high ground... If we were to one day reclaim the eastern lands, it would be like having our throat held by Yan... That would be a serious problem.'

But that was not a concern for the present moment. Li Zhouwei turned his gaze toward Chefu Prefecture, secretly used his Spirit Probe to assess the situation, and then turned his head to ask,

"Who... is guarding this place? And why don't I see the array you spoke of?"

Qiao Wenliu smiled.

"King Wei may not know... but for over two hundred years, the situation has been stable. There have been no major wars between Yan and Zhao, Mount Dayang has become more involved in the mortal world, and the Way of Great Desire has spread its Buddhist Land, constraining the Yan Buddhists. So no one has bothered to activate this grand array—after all, keeping it active for long periods is costly, not to mention troublesome for cultivation, making it difficult to even traverse the Great Void."

"As for the guard of this place...."

Qiao Wenliu hesitated, looking somewhat uncertain. Wu Miao quickly interjected,

"It is a minor general, a man Daoist Master Qiao is not familiar with. His surname is Bian, and his given name is Fan. He was originally a cultivator from the south and is the adopted son of Daoist Master Lu An..."

He seemed slightly anxious as he glanced at the three of them.

"This man is utterly loyal to the Lu family and has always been strict in his duties. If King Wei is so inclined, you could bypass this place and head west first..."

Hearing this, Liu Changdie immediately frowned and said,

"If we bypass this place and continue west, and a great battle breaks out, causing a celestial phenomenon, the Daoist Master here would surely know. If he activates the grand array and the Great Void stagnates, wouldn't our path of retreat be cut off?"

Wu Miao just gave an awkward smile. Li Zhouwei waved his hand and said with a grin,

"Daoist Master Wu, go down and pay him a visit. Just say... you've come on behalf of an old friend from Aiding City and tell him to come out of the city and surrender."

Entering another's grand array alone was an extremely dangerous affair. The Daoist Master's gaunt face tightened slightly, and his heart sank. Fortunately, he showed no hesitation in his actions, respectfully bowing before immediately riding the wind downward!

...

Chefu.

Upon the dais of the dark hall stood a high table, shimmering with divine light. A man sat in a side seat, built strong and imposing. He had one leg propped up on his seat and the other resting near the table, a cup of fine wine in his hand and a heavy look in his eyes.

His other hand, resting on the table, held a letter with shimmering gold characters that made him ponder for a long time, until he finally set down his cup, stood up, and began to pace back and forth within the great hall.

'Father said... King Wei...'

Bian Fan was currently only one hundred and thirty years old, yet he was already a Daoist Master with two divine abilities. His talent could be considered extremely high. Otherwise, he would not have been adopted by the esteemed Lu family. His body glowed with a crimson light, the rare Hengzhu divine ability.

He turned the letter over and over again before, with a flick of his hand, he incinerated it completely. Lowering his gaze, he gritted his teeth.

"King Wei... Bright Yang..."

His hands were clenched into iron fists. Suddenly, he saw someone come up from below and kneel before the great hall, crying out in alarm,

"My lord! My lord! Someone has arrived outside!"

"Oh?"

Bian Fan narrowed his eyes and said,

"Which fellow Daoist is it?"

The man, terrified by some unknown fright, stammered,

"It's... a Daoist Master, shrouded in a sinister wind. He claims to have come on behalf of an old friend from Aiding City... and wants my lord to..."

Bian Fan's eyes flashed, and the man began to tremble in fear. Steeling himself, he finally said,

"He wants my lord to come out of the array and surrender."

For a moment, the great hall fell silent as the expression on Bian Fan's face froze, then transformed into a towering rage, and he cursed,

"What audacity! How dare he shame a Daoist Master of the Lu family like this!"

He snatched the arcane saber from the main seat and stormed outside, his fury causing those around him to drop to their knees in fright. His eldest son, Bian Han, immediately rushed forward and knelt as well, crying out in alarm,

"Father! That King Wei has already reached the realm of Great Daoist Master! You must not leave the array rashly, for fear of an ambush!"

Bian Fan sneered.

"How could I not know? But the Chefu grand array is under my command, and the Great Void supports me. I can advance and retreat as I please. The Great Daoist Master Longkang is rushing east as we speak. If I can just lure him and hold him here, I will surely avenge the shame of Aiding City..."

Bian Han immediately drew back his sleeves and looked up at his father. Seeing his righteous and unwavering expression, he understood and said with tears in his eyes,

"With the Lu family so shamed, your son dares not try to persuade you!"

Bian Fan immediately soared into the air as the entire grand array roared to life. He passed through the Great Void and saw a figure standing ominously in the darkness, most likely Qiao Sanyi. Without hesitation, he unleashed his divine ability, its light illuminating the sky as he cursed,

"You dog thief."

Horizon-Filling Brilliance!

A bloody light rippled outwards, and crimson flames surged. Coordinated with the lockdown of the Great Void, the sinister light was instantly fixed in mid-air, enveloped in what seemed like a domain of dark, bloody fire, smashing down upon the person before him.

Wu Miao was terrified!

He knew this King Wei had an undefeated record and suspected there might be a twist. Though he was terribly afraid of death, his divine ability ready to flee at a moment's notice, he never expected this profound grand array to activate so suddenly, coordinating with a burst of power to pin him in place.

Bian Fan, treating him as the formidable Qiao Sanyi and knowing that Lesser Yin controlled water and fire, held nothing back. The divine ability came crashing down, engulfing Wu Miao's face in flames, causing him to cry out in pain as his own divine ability instantly activated.

Chamber of Doubt!

He intended to flee, but he heard the stout man before him suddenly change his tone, his divine ability still churning as he said urgently,

"Fellow Daoist, wait! Where is King Wei?"

Half of Wu Miao's Veiled Yin divine ability had already escaped when he suddenly heard this spiritual message. To go or not to go, he was torn, his heart aching with indecision. He could only stop and say,

"Fellow Daoist Bian..."

Bian Fan said urgently,

"I have long heard of King Wei's benevolent reputation! My father sent a letter just yesterday. With my divine ability now active in the sky, there may be reinforcements to the west. I will secretly let you pass. Please, ask King Wei to hurry west and catch them off guard!"

"Ah?"

Wu Miao wore a strange expression. He could only endure the pain, extinguish the flames on his face, and ask,

"Once we have passed... what about you, fellow Daoist?"

Bian Fan spoke quickly, "I will operate the grand array to isolate the two areas, block any pursuers for King Wei, and create confusion to prepare for any changes!"

Wu Miao understood, and for a moment, his teeth ached. He couldn't help but ask,

"Why did you have to hit me?"

Bian Fan, unaware of where this "have to" came from, was momentarily stunned before explaining,

"The city is full of spies. If I didn't make a grand show of it, how could I deceive everyone? My 'Horizon-Filling Brilliance' has the ability to conceal secrets. By enveloping the sky, we can have this private conversation..."

Wu Miao could only remain silent. He raised his hand in a salute and quietly transformed into a sinister light, slipping away. As expected, he saw that a long path had been cleared in the Great Void. King Wei stood there with his hands behind his back, a faint smile on his face.

"King Wei's judgment is sharp....."

Without another word, the group silently traversed the Great Void, speeding westward. Liu Changdie secretly transmitted a message using his divine ability,

"This may be the repayment by Lu Fu, but we must be cautious. If this man is engaged in counter-espionage and cuts off our retreat when we try to leave, we will be in great trouble!"

Liu Changdie's concern was not without reason. If Li Zhouwei had not used his Spirit Probe, he too would have had his doubts. But now, having scanned even the letter Lu An sent to Bian Fan, he knew the situation clearly. After a moment of thought, he secretly nodded.

'Bian Fan...'

He had originally thought there was no opportunity to exploit in Chefu Prefecture and had planned to go around it. But as soon as he learned the origins of the one guarding this place, he immediately used his Spirit Probe and made a decision.

'This is an unexpected delight...'

He began to ponder.

'In that case... this is no longer just about maneuvering. With this grand array at our back... we can truly aim for something substantial.'

He had been maneuvering in the north for many days, and while many had surrendered, their reasons were all starkly different.

'Tang and Zhou surrendered to the circumstances, yet they remain resentful and cannot be entrusted with important tasks. Qiao Wenliu surrendered out of principle and for personal gain, which is why he can be sent to fight in all directions. Wu Miao has no one to rely on and can only surrender to me in hopes of joining the mystic circles, making him a suitable envoy...'

Who was Bian Fan?

As an adopted son able to receive news so early and pledge allegiance to him, Li Zhouwei, as if presenting a token of trust, he was undoubtedly one of the Lu family's core members.

His status was, in a way, more solid than any of the men by his side. With his connections, even if Li Zhouwei ultimately retreated, the Lu family could at most make a casual excuse, and no one would be able to touch him!

It was precisely because of this that he could act so recklessly without considering a path of retreat, remaining behind to openly block off an entire region!

And once this man switched sides and held Chefu, as long as the Lu family didn't show up, he could defend the array to the death. Any passing Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would have to take the long way around.

Even if a Great Daoist Master came to capture him, they would first have to dismantle the array—Chefu was a crucial stronghold for Gu Prefecture and Chun City against the north. If it were dismantled and the Yan cultivators marched south, millions of people would be lost. No one could bear that responsibility!

If Bian Fan stubbornly refused to budge, the other masters would surely ask Lu An to intervene first. With this father and son pair acting in concert, if they were determined to delay for him, who knew how long it would take!

'The situation changes like lightning. In that case, the original plan can be overturned...'

The world knew of the grudge between him and the Qi family. Li Zhouwei had intended to use this, planning to bypass Chefu, conquer a few prefectures, and feign an attack on the Qi family. Li Zhouwei was certain that a Great Daoist Master was lying in ambush in the Qi family's High-Peak City and had no intention of actually conquering it, only to break away midway and leave this group of people stranded in the north.

"But... as long as... the southerners are delayed long enough before Chefu..."

The light in his eyes gradually brightened.

"High-Peak City... it might not be impossible to turn the feint into a real attack and take it down..."

With Bian Fan setting a trap to lure the enemy, reinforcements from High-Peak City would likely come, or at least they would send someone to investigate. If that Great Daoist Master was aggressive and came in person, the four of them could surround him and force his retreat.

"Once that Great Daoist Master retreats, High-Peak City will surely fall into my hands!"

His gaze grew deeper. The glow of their divine abilities in the Great Void slowly dimmed, but their speed did not decrease in the slightest as they flew rapidly westward. Scenery continuously swept past on the ground below. Li Zhouwei stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes slowly closing.

The range of his Spirit Probe was immense. In just an instant, he vaguely detected a figure rushing towards them from a distance, having already covered more than half the journey!

'He's coming so fast?'

A thought flashed through Li Zhouwei's mind.

'It seems he started heading this way as soon as Mount Jiao fell!'

This person was dressed in crimson robes and appeared quite old. The fiery virtue emanating from his body was tremendous, as if it would soar into the heavens. His expression was grave, revealing immense Dao-Profundity as he rode a Blazing Fire, drifting towards them.

Looking at his face, he bore a slight resemblance to the Qi Lanyan of yesteryear, only older, showing signs of age.

'A member of the Qi family...'

This scene, reflected in Li Zhouwei's eyes, caused him to pause slightly.

For no other reason than that this man was merely a Daoist Master of two divine abilities.

There was no hatred for the Qi family in his eyes, nor any other superfluous emotion, only a flash of regret as he sighed internally,

"They are still cautious, only sending a Qi family member... Though the speed of this Blazing Fire cultivator is fast, his cultivation is simply not high enough. It seems he isn't here as a reinforcement, but rather to seize control of Chefu from Bian Fan before I arrive... to put this Qi family member, who is bound to be my enemy, in charge!"

And within the vision of his Spirit Probe, this person had already seen the celestial phenomenon to the east. He stopped abruptly in shock, observing from afar, seemingly using some kind of ocular art.

'Good... if I cannot take High-Peak City, I will take away the firewood from under the cauldron!'

The situation changed in an instant, and so his plans shifted with it, allowing no one to guess his intentions. In a flash of lightning, Li Zhouwei's expression changed. He swiftly raised his hand, and with a flick of his sleeve, he actually removed the black, gold-patterned spiritual robe from his body and, under the stunned gazes of the others, handed it to Liu Changdie!

The King of Wei's tone was fast and urgent, "Daoist Master Yuanbian, you are beyond the calculations of all cultivators and all Daos, and you have cultivated the arts of Vault and Harmonising, concealing your presence. In a moment, put on my robe, hold the Huai River Map, secretly unfurl the Heavenly Light, and speed west, straight for High-Peak City!"

Liu Changdie, not understanding, could only hastily accept it as he heard Li Zhouwei continue,

"Someone will surely see you on the way. If they dare not stop you, halt eighty miles from High-Peak City and wait for the time it takes an incense stick to burn. During this time, if anyone comes out of High-Peak City, immediately activate your divine ability and flee back here at top speed!"

Liu Changdie nodded solemnly. Li Zhouwei waited a moment, then deliberately rose up on a beam of Heavenly Light, pretending to be disturbed by the Chefu grand array in the Great Void.

A great unfurling of Heavenly Light!

In that instant, within the brilliant Heavenly Light, he indeed felt a gaze fall upon him. With a look of awareness, he raised his head and cast a cold glance into the distance—a glance so ghostly that the distant flame trembled for a moment in mortal terror, then turned and fled!

"Go!"

He barked. Liu Changdie, sensing his solemnity, did not hesitate. He unleashed his divine ability, his aura growing deep and profound, and riding the Heavenly Light, he hurried west!

Li Zhouwei watched as the Heavenly Light and the flame disappeared over the horizon, sighing inwardly.

'It's a pity Wan'er is not here. With her arts of transformation, this plan would have been flawless... For now... I can only bet that this fellow is scared out of his wits and won't turn back to fight!'

This move with Liu Changdie was merely to confuse the Great Daoist Master in High-Peak City as much as possible. It would be best if it worked, but it didn't matter if it didn't. Li Zhouwei stopped thinking about it and surveyed his surroundings, his voice low and mysterious,

"Mount Jiao is the territory of the twelve families. The Buddhist cultivators are greedy, but the light of their Buddhist Land cannot intrude; it disperses upon contact. A Great Daoist Master must be coming to suppress it. Now that they've seen my might in Chefu shaking the heavens, they will surely approach from the south to the north, intending to corner us. Everyone, follow me back the way we came. We will go to Chefu and, with the help of the grand array, intercept this person instead!"
