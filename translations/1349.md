# Chapter 1349: Vicious Deceit

The lamps in the side hall flickered.

The doors were shut tight, and the hall was tranquil. An old man sat to the side, perfectly at ease, holding a teacup and blowing gently on its surface. Though deep behind enemy lines, he seemed as comfortable as if he were in his own courtyard, utterly content.

Before him, a young man paced the hall with his hands behind his back, his expression relaxed. He showed no concern for the person who had been summoned away, pausing occasionally to take a small talisman from his sleeve and examine it in the light.

But only a few breaths had passed when footsteps approached. One set of steps came all the way to the front of the hall before stopping abruptly, turning, and departing, while the other pushed the door open.

_Creeak..._

Pang Yi looked up to see a man in red robes entering. He was exceptionally handsome, though the corners of his eyes were a bit narrow and his cheekbones were as sharp as if carved by a knife. His golden eyes, however, were what was truly intimidating, causing Pang Yi's expression to shift slightly.

Pang Queyun rose abruptly. Pang Yi had already performed a very solemn bow, saying,

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

There was only one bloodline with golden eyes. The father and son naturally didn't need to think twice to know that the person before them had to be Li Jiangqian!

A thought stirred in Pang Yi's heart, and he couldn't help but begin to deliberate.

Pang Yi was stationed at the second pass and had likewise made his own conjectures about this opponent.

'This man may not possess any extraordinary skills, but he is incredibly ruthless. His standing provides no support, and he still dares to use figures from the Netherworld, which shows he harbors ambitions that are anything but trivial!'

He, Pang Yi, preferred to act with just cause, seeking credit from the immortal nobility and prioritizing self-preservation above all. Only as a last resort would he kill with a borrowed knife. Playing the Underworld was, in his view, extremely domineering and reeked of malevolence.

'If a man dares to scheme against even the Underworld, who is there that he would not dare to scheme against?'

Thus, he was quite wary of Li Jiangqian. Outwardly, he was polite and courteous, and his own father also stood up from the side and approached with a smile. Unexpectedly, this highness did not say much, instead walking to the main seat and sitting down himself.

Pang Queyun was quite old, yet showed no arrogance. He immediately followed, intending to pour tea for this highness, but the crimson-robed youth straightened up, pressed down on his hand, and said,

"Ah... old senior, you flatter me too much!"

Pang Queyun shook his head repeatedly. Before he could speak, Li Jiangqian had already stood upright and sighed,

"Senior Pang, there's no need to be so courteous. Changli came this time because I heard some gossip and was thus entrusted by Daoist Master Yu to ask you two a few questions..."

Pang Yi narrowed his eyes, gave a deep bow, and said with feigned shock,

"Your Highness, what is the meaning of this!"

Li Jiangqian swept a thoughtful gaze over him and sneered.

"Just as I thought! You two truly are petty men who sow discord, wasting Daoist Master Yu's earnest efforts... Father is, after all, more perceptive than I!"

The father and son stood together, communicating secretly, cursing in their hearts.

'This brat is trying to bluff us!'

Pang Yi, however, had to give him face, and said with a mixture of shock and doubt,

"Your Highness..."

Li Jiangqian said coldly, "Do you two know... that when Daoist Master Gu was captured by my father, he deeply resented you, fellow Daoist, for playing both sides, cursing you endlessly? My father, in turn, admires his character and has long been quite dissatisfied with you two..."

"He then asked his many subordinates with divine abilities, and some said that you two are true villains. Now... with the abnormalities in the city, Father already suspects you two are stirring up trouble, intending for Longkang Yao to fight to the bitter end!"

'Nonsense, what does this have to do with my Pang clan...'

Pang Yi sneered internally, and Pang Queyun was equally dismissive. On the surface, however, he gave a deep bow and sighed,

"My Pang clan has always had excellent relationships within the Prefecture. How could a fellow Daoist slander us like this!"

"Excellent?"

Li Jiangqian let out a great laugh and said, "I won't say who it was, but do you know what they said about you! Someone said: 'Pang Yi takes advantage of situations to avoid harm, not hesitating to wantonly slaughter living beings. He schemes for short-term gain at the cost of the future and dares to abandon the critical task of stabilizing the realm. He is nothing but a petty man.'"

He said: "Wanton slaughter of living beings and betraying righteous men are both taboos for my father. Seeing the situation was amiss, I asked, 'How does Pang Queyun compare to his son?'"

"And a fellow Daoist immediately replied: 'The son is the spitting image of the father!'"

The two exchanged a glance, caught somewhat off guard. They saw the young man had already risen to his feet, seemingly displeased by their silence, and rather impulsively said in a cold voice,

"These words are clear for all to see, and heaven and earth can bear witness! If no one said this before King Wei, then may my Quest for Gold fail, may the lands of Zhao suffer retribution, and may my divine abilities dissipate into thin air!"

As this great oath was spoken, the bright light in his eyes flickered slightly, as if his very life-mandate had instantly sensed it, leaving the two men standing frozen in place.

'Ah?!'

Pang Yi's expression finally wavered. His brow furrowed deeply as disbelief and suspicion rose in his heart.

'How is that possible!'

'Although my family isn't some great Daoist Tradition, we've always been tactful. We've never offended anyone and have even forged many connections. How could someone say such things before King Wei!'

The father and son remained silent, but the atmosphere had clearly shifted. Li Jiangqian said faintly,

"Although my father didn't answer, as his son, I understand his thoughts to some extent. With the current stalemate, you must be speculating about Gu You's life. If anything were to happen, Father would certainly place the blame on you two!"

He sneered.

"No wonder Daoist Master Yu is anxious. You two are being used and don't even know it. What kind of plan could a rogue cultivator come up with? Who is the one behind you? I fear they intentionally want to ruin you father-and-son's reputation with my father... Why don't you think about what consequences that will bring?"

Pang Yi's heart skipped a beat.

'Fu He?'

Logically, he, Pang Yi, had a tacit understanding with Fu He. Ye Tuji appeared to be a rogue cultivator, but Longkang Yao, who spent his years in a grotto-heaven, didn't know that this person was a childhood friend of both Pang Yi and Fu He, and they had once cultivated together in another grotto-heaven...

'According to our understanding, as long as Ye Tuji brings back news that Gu You is dead, and we say a few ambiguous things on the side, then if something goes wrong, Fu He will be the one to take responsibility.'

'Could it be that he placed a piece on Bright Yang's side in advance, intending to shift the responsibility with King Wei onto me? To force me to stand with him?'

He was still uncertain, but Li Jiangqian didn't require his suspicion. His Highness strode down and said with a smile,

"I, however, don't care. That person is full of flaws and was seen through by my father long ago. Let me be clear with you, fellow Daoist! The moment Ye Tuji returns, Father will set out simultaneously to personally visit the pass, expose your Pang clan's instigation, and return Gu You to Daoist Master Longkang!"

This sentence struck Pang Yi like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, making his heart clench.

If what Li Jiangqian said was true, then it had already completely erased any possibility of him colluding with Fu He!

Once Ye Tuji returned and falsely reported Gu You's death, he and Fu He would vouch for it. But then Longkang Yao would take one step forward and immediately receive Gu You back. What fate would await them then?

'Gu You only needs to think for a moment, and with that explosive temper of his... he will absolutely see us as mortal enemies. What's more, we would have completely offended Longkang Yao and Blazing Aridity Heaven!'

He frowned, finally dropping his pretense, and said in a low voice,

"King Wei is actually willing to just hand over the excellent situation in the east!"

Li Jiangqian laughed heartily, leaned in, and said in a low voice,

"What 'excellent situation'? Fellow Daoist... if this fight continues, are you going to let that person from the grotto-heaven intervene? The resources have been seized, and all the divine abilities have been subdued by Bright Yang. Why is there any need to keep pushing east? Does your Chun City hold the lost treasure of the Wei Emperor, or is it a Bright Yang sanctuary? Must you break through in one go? Do you really think the Yan Kingdom is just a corpse!"

Pang Yi's head snapped up, his heart pounding:

'His meaning is... the tacit understanding with the Yan Kingdom... is limited... even fragile...'

He said in a low voice, "Daoist Master Yu has great face."

Li Jiangqian let out a laugh. "Fellow Daoist Pang, you don't need to pretend. Father cherishes talent, and I, of course, hope to earn some merit in his eyes. You and I are both intelligent people. To be perfectly honest, I hold you, fellow Daoist, in high regard, and I value the Pang clan as well..."

He continued faintly, "Senior Queyun has been stuck in the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm for many years. Daoist Master Yu mentioned needing 【 Green Basket Millet Qi 】. Spiritual items of the three yins are scarce in the north, and the few that exist are in the hands of those great Daoist Traditions. But in our eyes, are they not just trivial things? Not only can we satisfy the senior's needs for all these items, but after we sweep across the east, all items of Veiled Yin can also be given to the senior for his priority selection."

The old man's breathing suddenly grew heavy. He stared intently at him, a sudden realization exploding in his mind.

'They're at Moongaze Lake! The ancestral land of Donghua!'

Li Jiangqian's voice grew lower, filled with ambition,

"The senior and I share a common interest. I also need a Great Daoist Master to support me under my father. Although Qiao Wenliu is on the verge of comprehending the Purple Mystery, he is but a brute and cannot compare to you two. Daoist Master Yu's heart is set on True Qi, and I cannot persuade him, so he recommended Senior Pang to me... There is much our two sides can achieve together..."

Pang Yi tilted his head slightly to look at his father. Pang Queyun's eyes were shut tight, and he said nothing.

Only then did Li Jiangqian stand up, looking down from his superior position as he said,

"Of course, if you, fellow Daoist, are too afraid of offending them, you can also go back, explain the stakes to that person, and stop the plot against Gu You—but then I must ask you to guess, will King Wei still go to Chun City to release Gu You? If he doesn't, and you watch a chance to turn weapons into jade and silk slip by, will that side not be filled with regret and grow suspicious of you two? Might you end up pleasing neither side..."

The young man sat leisurely in the main seat with his legs crossed, the words from his mouth sounding like a careless remark. Pang Yi, however, let out a long breath. Seeing that his father still remained silent, he knew his heart had been moved. He finally lowered his head and said resentfully,

"If this matter succeeds, Your Highness must tell me who it was that slandered my Pang clan before King Wei!"

A corner of Li Jiangqian's mouth lifted as he said, "When the time comes, I will personally tell you their full name!"

"Good!"

Pang Yi performed a deep bow, as if a heavy burden had been lifted, or as if he had finally found a patron and could now realize his ambitions. The light in his eyes brightened as he said through gritted teeth,

"Fu He is rash and witless, and Lu An is timid and cowardly! I, Pang, have had enough of them long ago!"

Li Jiangqian simply helped him up and said, "So his name is Fu He."

In that brief moment of thought, Li Jiangqian had actually considered all sorts of methods:

'The opponent's strategy succeeded only because they gambled that we didn't know there was someone by Longkang Yao's side, and didn't know this Great Daoist Master couldn't even control his own subordinates. Now, with the reminder from the south, there are far too many ways to break this deadlock...'

There was even an immediate and direct solution. As long as he controlled one of them, Pang Queyun or Pang Yi, he wouldn't have to worry about the other one not telling the truth upon returning!

'It's just that this method could easily be turned against me by that Fu He, who could accuse the Pang clan of not speaking the truth...'

Li Zhouwei's meaning was very clear. What did "Do not be stingy." mean? It was nothing more than a bribe. The reason for going to such lengths to win over these two was to turn their own scheme against them!

'Making Fu He's plot fail isn't difficult. The key is to make him completely lose credibility with Longkang Yao, to push the person behind the scenes who wishes to interfere into direct opposition with Longkang Yao and Gu You. Let them understand that someone is pushing Gu Prefecture and Bright Yang to fight to the bitter end; let them understand who truly harbors ill intentions, and whose hand holds the knife!'

'I must make Fu He be the first to jump out!'

This was true suppression on a strategic level, not some petty gain from countering a single move.

Their Li clan could even use this as a springboard to mediate their relationship with Longkang Yao and Gu You, possibly even subjugating these forces that could be won over, and ultimately bring them under their command!

He smiled and guided the conversation, "Those who spend their years cultivating in grotto-heavens may have Daoist aspirations, but when it comes to manipulating situations and leveraging power, how could they possibly be a match for people like us? After this matter is concluded, fellow Daoist, you will need to spend some time in Gu Prefecture. You must consider this!"

What kind of person was Pang Yi? He nodded slightly and said with a smile, "Your Highness need not worry! This Pang understands!"

Li Jiangqian's overt scheme was laid bare. When Pang Yi returned, he would certainly ruin the Fu clan's calculations. So, to protect himself amidst this, what would he need to do?

Of course, it was to sow discord and set the Fu clan against Longkang Yao! Otherwise, who would protect him?

When it came to cultivating the Dao and expounding on scriptures, Pang Yi would admit he was inferior. But when it came to sowing discord and killing with a borrowed knife, he had never been weaker than anyone... Not even this highness before him, who had so astonished him, could necessarily best him at it!

Their eyes—one pair black, one pair gold—met, and everything was understood without words. Pang Yi simply lifted a teacup, presented it to His Highness, and said, full of emotion,

"When Xiaoqing was in Chun City, the people I worked with were merely so-so. They were either Daoists who expounded scriptures and cultivated, disdaining worldly affairs, or mediocre generals who, despite their wisdom and courage, were bound by conventional morality. When have I ever met a figure such as Your Highness? It must be that the heavens felt something, unwilling to let my solitary ambitions go unled, and thus allowed me to meet you!"

That the unscrupulous Pang Yi actually had a gentle-sounding Daoist name like "Xiaoqing,"[^6] like a pale-scaled venomous snake, hiding its true nature, moved Li Jiangqian. He sighed and said,

"Am I not the same! Changli has followed father in governing the lake and has fought in campaigns for many years, yet I have never met someone who could know my intentions with a single glance. Now that I have met fellow Daoist Pang, I have finally found a kindred spirit."

The two arrived in the main hall. Pang Yi gave a long sigh and said, "If I did not have to return to see Longkang Yao, this Pang would swear a Dao oath to never fail Your Highness!"

Li Jiangqian shook his head and said, "Please take care of yourself. First, go to the main hall and accompany that rogue cultivator to see King Wei. See things clearly for yourself!"

Their tacit understanding had a precondition: that Gu You had truly not perished. Otherwise, there was no guarantee that this highness wasn't using him to scheme against Longkang Yao... At that point, having offended both sides, Pang Yi would surely die without a burial place. He did not dare to be careless, so he agreed politely and immediately headed for the main hall.

And his father remained silent throughout, consistently letting this most favored son of his decide the future of the Pang clan. The old man only walked to the front of the hall, and before leaving, he performed a deep bow and sighed,

"May King Wei no longer doubt my son and me!"

Li Jiangqian nodded, walked back with his hands clasped behind him, and sat in the seat of honor. He gazed at the hall doors with a smile, the gold of his eyes seeming even deeper under the sun's light. He tapped lightly on the armrest with unclear meaning and murmured to himself,

'How can using a gentleman compare to using a villain!'

'In the end, villains are more useful... It is only a pity... that in this world, clever villains who understand the times are, after all, far, far too few...'
