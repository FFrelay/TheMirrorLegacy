# Chapter 1325: Change of Direction

Merging Fire raged across the heavens, dyeing the sky in its light. The old Daoist Master stood between heaven and earth, a dense azure light in his hands that flowed like a waterfall of condensed Horn Wood, repelling the flames one by one.

Wen Daoping felt a gloom settle over his heart.

His Wen clan's foundation was not shallow. Wen Daoping cultivated Horn Wood and was extremely famous in the north. Everyone had respected him over the years. After all, which clan did not have disciples on the brink of death, or with injured divine abilities?

Yet it was precisely because he cultivated Horn Wood that he was naturally at a disadvantage in a fight.

And Qiao Sanyi before him was renowned for his ferocity in battle. His Dao-Profundity was high, and his Lesser Yin divine ability was bizarre. He could neither win a fight nor escape. Having been blocked twice in a row, he knew the other party would show no mercy and had no intention of letting him leave, and he was overcome with frustration.

He took a deep breath, only to see four rays of Bright Yang light from the horizon materialize nearby, coalescing into a youth in ink-black robes, his expression serene. The halberd and battle-axe were gone. He was empty-handed, yet he projected an even greater sense of pressure.

No more words were needed. The old Daoist Master felt only a deep chill in his heart.

'Lu Fu is out of luck again! I wonder how this is going to end this time!'

Wen Daoping raised his head and let out a long sigh.

"Though Mount Jiao is an ancient immortal mountain, it is hardly a strategic point. King Wei… why must you go to such lengths!"

He truly could not comprehend it.

'For him to come personally with the raging Merging Fire, bringing along Qiao Sanyi, the most formidable fighter of the mid-Purple Mansion Realm, is one thing… but he also has the Drum of Profound Thunder!'

What did it mean for the Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder to be a first-grade treasure? Back then, the Thunder Palace had placed it in their great hall for the Thunder Emissaries who patrolled the world to use in exterminating demons—which referred to the practitioners of the current Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao! As long as one’s divine abilities were not yet perfected, no matter what skills they possessed, they would be helplessly immobilized.

What was more terrifying was that he had never heard of Li Zhouwei using it before.

If this were deployed in a major battle, dispatched with a thunder-cultivating divine ability to be brought out unexpectedly, it could even turn the tide of the entire conflict. Such a powerful treasure, kept hidden all this time, was now being used on the insignificant Mount Jiao!

He felt utterly helpless, performed a deep bow, and said,

"I was unaware of Your Majesty's arrival from afar. What are your instructions?"

Mount Jiao had fallen in an instant, and the youth was in high spirits. But the old man's question was not a simple one. It not only caused the Merging Fire in the sky to slowly wane, but also made Qiao Wenliu, who stood beside him, fall deep into thought.

The great formation of Mount Jiao was already destroyed.

'King Wei sought a swift victory and has already destroyed the great formation here. Numerous formation platforms have collapsed with a roar. Although the formation plates are not completely ruined, so it is not a total loss, rebuilding it… would certainly take more than a year or two.'

This meant it was now nearly impossible for Li Zhouwei to use this place as a stronghold!

But Li Zhouwei paid it no mind, smiling as he called out,

"Daoist Master Yuanbian!"

Liu Changdie hastily descended from the sky. The small drum was still clutched tightly to his chest, its light flickering. The middle-aged man had only just acquired this treasure and was terrified another fight would break out, so he maintained the spell art without dispelling it. He answered the call and listened as King Wei commanded,

"Take the formation plates."

Of course, Li Zhouwei had no intention of staying here for long.

'The Way of Great Desire and Mount Dayang are not far. Those two would love nothing more than to obstruct me. The Daoist Masters of the southern gateway, upon seeing Merging Fire light up the eastern sky, will surely send aid…'

Though Li Zhouwei's divine abilities were formidable, he could not withstand an encirclement from three sides. To remain here was to sit and wait for death—his violent destruction of the formation from the very start was done precisely to shatter this southern gateway, allowing him to come and go as he pleased!

Hearing his words, Liu Changdie simply pinched his fingers in a quick calculation and got an immediate response. He strode through the Great Void and into the main hall. Wen Daoping's heart sank with a terrible premonition. He turned, his gaze pleading with Qiao Wenliu for help.

Qiao Wenliu understood immediately. He cupped his hands and said,

"The elder Daoist Master Wen is a man of great prestige and renown. The Wen clan is a prominent family among the prefectures, one of the twelve great families… If Your Majesty spares his life, I, Qiao, am willing to act as his guarantor and have the elder pledge his service to Bright Yang!"

These words had yet to move Li Zhouwei, but they stunned Wen Daoping, who thought in horror,

'How did this become about me serving Bright Yang!'

Qiao Wenliu was not wrong. The Wen clan to which Wen Daoping belonged was one of the twelve great families of the age, descendants of the True Monarch Chixiung, which was why they held such a rank. To be blunt, now that Wen Daoping had caught his breath, his fear had actually lessened!

'I told you to clarify my background and explain the stakes, not to overstep your authority and decide for me!'

Qiao Wenliu’s words put him in an awkward position, yet the King of Wei's expression remained largely unchanged as he spoke softly,

"The twelve great families?"

Seeing that the old Daoist Master did not immediately respond, Qiao Wenliu grew displeased. He cursed him inwardly for his shamelessness, and his tone shifted slightly, a faint, mocking smile on his lips.

"He is a descendant of a True Monarch. His ancestor was the Comprehending Profundity, True Monarch Chixiung, a disciple of Lord Xu Xiang and the junior brother of the two Lus."

"No wonder Lu Fu was here."

This third sentence fell on deaf ears. The old man still stood there, his neck stiff—clearly, this Daoist Master Wen retained his pride and his backing, utterly unwilling to bow his head as easily as that Daoist Lu had.

Li Zhouwei's patience reached its limit. When his third sentence ended without a reply, the smile on his face had already faded. He turned his palm upward, and a small urn, neither quite wood nor not wood, materialized, dripping with the light of Protecting Wood.

He said coldly,

"What twelve great families? Will you go in yourself, or must I shatter your divine abilities, cripple your Dharma Body, and throw you in?"

Wen Daoping's face turned ashen. His hands, clenched tightly before him, trembled slightly. He looked as if he wanted to flick his sleeves in anger but restrained himself in light of the situation. His beard quivered as he began to speak,

"King Wei, such immense prestig—"

"Clang!"

Without warning, before his words could even ring out, the Dharma sword at the ink-robed youth's waist leaped forth. A speckled radiance, like flecks of blood, burst out. In that instant, the world turned a vast, bleak gray, all color frozen within the night!

Wen Daoping was like a fly trapped in amber, his old face locked stiffly within the colorless world. A fist like steel whistled through the air and smashed into his face.

"BOOM!"

Li Zhouwei was known among cultivators as the Qilin of the Mortal World. The might of his Dharma Body was immense. At such close range and without any warning, the whistling passage of the attack made even Qiao Wenliu’s hair stand on end, his mind going blank for a heartbeat.

In an instant, the old man's entire head twisted out of shape like a rotten watermelon and burst apart!

"Have mercy!"

Qiao Wenliu's horrified cry froze in the air. In the next moment, a second fist had already landed on the old man's chest. Following his shattered head, his thin torso was instantly blown to pieces. Blood like azure light erupted, transforming into the shapes of various birds in mid-air, only to be torn to shreds by the brilliant Merging Fire!

"Your Majesty!"

Qiao Wenliu was utterly horrified!

What was Wen Daoping's cultivation level? The Wen brothers of this generation were unimpressive; he was the only one to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, and he had only managed to scrape his way to three divine abilities at his advanced age by relying on his ancestor's legacy. He was never a fighter to begin with. Compared to a Qilin, his Horn Wood Dharma Body was as fragile as tofu. How could it possibly withstand two cold punches from the Great Daoist Master White Qilin at such an close range?

He hastily withdrew his divine ability and restrained the Horn Wood, only to find the ground littered with shimmering green flesh and blood. Half an eyeball was still rolling on the ground. The old man had been beaten to a pulp!

But his own temper was not much better, and seeing this, he felt a certain satisfaction.

'That old bastard really knew how to put on airs… Serves him right!'

Aloud, however, he cried out,

"Your Majesty, quell your anger!"

Reason quickly took over. Qiao Wenliu had no time for other concerns. With a fierce flick of his sleeve, he swept the mass of cyan light from the ground like so much dust and tossed it into the urn. Only then did he bow and say in a low voice,

"This subordinate failed in his duty…"

The youth, however, seemed unconcerned, as if he were not the one who had just thrown those two punches. He casually put the Spiritual Treasure away and smiled.

"He does have three divine abilities of Horn Wood, after all. He wouldn't be beaten to death by two of this King's punches. It looks miserable, but once he's pieced together inside, it won't be any major injury."

Qiao Wenliu sighed again and again. He glanced at King Wei's expression and said,

"That old fellow has always been famous… He assumed that as the descendant of junior of the two Lus, Your Majesty would grant him face as well. His family did produce a True Monarch, after all… And he thought Your Majesty needed him to stabilize the situation…"

His analysis was quite on point. Just then, someone approached from the side, spat, and sneered.

"What a joke. Did he think we came all this way to treat him with courtesy? He was too slow to surrender, so we let him taste whether his Dharma Body or a fist is harder!"

It was Liu Changdie.

Vault Metal was inherently suited for such tasks, and Qiao Wenliu had mentioned that the formation plates used Geng Metal. In a mere instant, Liu Changdie had pried them out. They were a solid turquoise green, marred by faint gray scorch marks, and he held them cupped in his hands.

Unlike Qiao Wenliu, who reveled in profit and battle, this Daoist Master Yuanbian was wholeheartedly devoted to the Li clan. Seeing this outcome, he was naturally quite pleased.

Li Zhouwei paid no mind to this interlude at all and remarked casually,

"Lu Fu was far more sensible than he was…"

The moment Qiao Wenliu saw Liu Changdie, he could not help but ask in a low voice,

"Fellow Daoist Liu, since you cultivate Vault Metal… did you happen to locate this place's treasury?"

Liu Changdie knew what he was thinking and replied with some difficulty,

"Of course… but my Vault Metal is for detection, not for breaching. This is a Purple Mansion cultivator's contingency. It can't be dealt with in a short time. I fear it would take too long."

"Correct."

Li Zhouwei raised his head and said,

"Leave the things here. As things stand, the forces from the Way of Great Desire, Mount Dayang, and Gu Prefecture will arrive shortly. If we leave these things behind, those monks will certainly become greedy. If even a few people from Gu Prefecture show up, it might even have the surprising effect of delaying them for us."

Qiao Wenliu nodded reluctantly, then asked hesitantly,

"For now…"

Li Zhouwei's tone was placid, but his words were shocking.

"First, we go north."

He soared into the air, silently stepping into the Great Void with the other two, and sped northward, his golden pupils blazing.

Within his Spirit Probe's field of vision, a divine ability had already risen into the sky from the prefectural city to the north. Whether to investigate or to mount a rescue, it was heading south through the Great Void!

'Perfect. I'll catch them red-handed.'

His divine ability moved with incredible speed, but Liu Changdie slapped his sleeve. The small drum vanished, replaced by the Huai River Map. Within his Shengyang Acupoint, something roiled, and the Profound Vault Invitation Letter quietly surfaced.

Liu Changdie looked somewhat crestfallen, but Qiao Wenliu was deeply impressed. He turned to look at him, his expression strange, and said,

"My knowledge is shallow, so I could not identify that thunder drum. But it seemed to me… that fellow Daoist Liu wielded it as if it were weightless?"

Li Zhouwei nodded in firm agreement.

The same question had risen in his own mind.

Liu Changdie had acquired the artifact through a rash exchange, and his own divine abilities and dharma power were not exceptional. Yet the might of that drum had been immense, its power sweeping away the great formation, even surpassing that of Qi Lanyan from years ago!

Hearing this, Liu Changdie just smiled.

"So that's what you were pondering, fellow Daoist. There is nothing surprising about it. This item was exchanged using the Profound Vault Invitation Letter, and its various marvels are activated through the Profound Vault. I merely provided the dharma power…"

"Otherwise, had I exchanged for the Merging Fire divine ability, given the clashing nature of metal and fire—and the most vicious Merging Fire at that—it wouldn't have been as simple as my earlier suggestion to retreat. I would have died on the spot!"

Understanding dawned on Qiao Wenliu. Even as a dignified Lesser Yin Daoist Master, a hint of envy soured his tone as he sighed,

"Truly formidable… What a pity…"

All three of them knew what he was lamenting.

'A pity to have exchanged for the Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder, but not for use in a major, head-on battle… Who knows what he'll get next time…'

Li Zhouwei had not originally held high expectations for Liu Changdie, but now his mind was filled with new considerations. His thoughts turned more toward how to better utilize this item. Shaking his head with a smile, he said,

"Let's be glad we arrived in time. No need for regrets. However… Senior Yuanbian, is gaining another divine ability the best way to enhance the power of the Profound Vault Invitation Letter? Besides Dao-Profundity, is there anything else that might be of use?"

Augmenting one's divine abilities was always the most effective path, but Liu Changdie's path of cultivation was already severed, that most direct route now closed to him. He looked downcast for a moment before saying,

"Your Majesty is wise. If I could gain another divine ability, there would be a high chance of selecting something roughly in line with my wishes. But that path is now blocked, and increasing my Dao-Profundity is hardly any easier—the Daoist canons for Vault Metal cannot even be found in Gu Prefecture, so how could they fall into the hands of people like us? I can only rely on my own slow enlightenment…"

Qiao Wenliu possessed high Dao-Profundity. A single glance at Liu Changdie's two divine abilities was enough for him to understand. He listened intently from the side, saying nothing.

"Besides that, there is one other thing, which is most convenient… and quite common."

Liu Changdie shook his head with a wry smile.

"Life-mandate."

He said quietly,

"Normally, this item can only be used to exchange for things of a certain standing, with relatively inferior materials. But if supplemented by pledging my life-mandate as collateral, it produces a great divine effect, allowing one to trade low for high, and it even possesses various imperceptible wonders. The only issue is that no matter how much is pledged, once it is given as collateral, it can never be returned. Even if you give back the pledged divine ability or Spiritual Treasure, you only recover the original item."

Li Zhouwei's brow furrowed at once. He was silent for a moment before saying,

"That is too heavy a price!"

To a cultivator, one's life-mandate was of the utmost importance. Even the slightest damage was cause for great distress. Unless one was truly desperate, it would never be used as a resource, and there were few methods to do so anyway.

Qiao Wenliu hesitated, a look of doubt on his face.

"Is this true? The Profound Vault is of the Encompassing Profundity's Great Dao. How could it demand a person's life-mandate? Fellow Daoist, could there be some misunderstanding?"

Liu Changdie lowered his head.

"I have my own insights from sensing the Profound Vault. Let me inform you, fellow Daoist—for those cultivators who nourish their nature through qi ingestion, a pledged life-mandate can indeed be returned. But what Dao do you and I cultivate? To put it bluntly, it is called the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. Once the life-mandate of a demonic cultivator is sent in, how could it ever be returned? I am only able to use this item in such a way because the Profound Vault has been without a master for a thousand years, my own life-mandate is pure, and I cultivate Vault Metal. Otherwise…"

"I'm afraid I would have perished on the spot!"

He gave a slight smile.

"This is a simple principle. Have you never wondered, fellow Daoist? Where did all the divine abilities in the Profound Vault come from? If it were due to the influence of the Golden Attainment, then there should only be the few divine abilities related to Vault Metal. Why are there so many Spiritual Treasures from outside Encompassing Profundity's own, a mix of miscellaneous, and even some from the lowest of schools?"

"How do you think all those divine abilities came to be in the Profound Vault? They are all from ancient demonic cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, captured by Encompassing Profundity. Their clans were exterminated, their fortunes plundered, their life-mandates dismembered, and their myriad wicked divine abilities sealed away inside!"

At these words, Qiao Wenliu was horrified into a stunned silence. It was a long moment before he recovered enough to speak.

"The Thunder Palace… was this during the time of the Thunder Palace?"

Liu Changdie sighed.

"Perhaps even earlier."

Qiao Wenliu fell silent.

He resided in Gu Prefecture, and though not accepted by the great noble clans, his ancestry was not low. He was on good terms with several families and had knowledge of the Daoist canons and classics, so he knew a great deal. He listened as Liu Changdie continued,

"Today, the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao is widespread and considered an orthodox path of the immortals, with ancient traditions of all sizes adopting its practice. But in ancient times, it was truly seen as inferior. Many cultivated it, but they were treated like weeds… The further back one goes, the more its practitioners were suspected of being demonic disciples."

Qiao Wenliu gave a cold sneer.

"Is it any different now? Only those who fail to achieve qi resonance after ten years are sent down to the mountains and forests to cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao in this mortal world. Or it's those who have already perfected their cultivation in one life who turn to it, hoping to patch up any deficiencies…"

He seemed to have stirred some unpleasant memories, for he continued with biting sarcasm,

"In their eyes, the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao is a shortcut, one created by some supreme genius. It's a derivative of the main principles, a way to complete the orthodox path, re-examine the fundamentals, review the inner and outer, and verify the Great Dao. But if you achieve five divine abilities in one life this way, you will inevitably lose in a fight, and your Dao-Profundity will be far inferior… They call such people opportunists, not even worth a mention."

Liu Changdie sighed but ultimately said no more. He saw Li Zhouwei shake his head, his gaze fixed on the deep darkness ahead as he said softly,

"Someone's coming."

…

Brilliant treasure light shone.

In the eastern part of the Great Zhao, north of the lands of Qi, there was a great desert by the sea. High mountains dotted the landscape, where golden lotuses bloomed in abudance and silver rivers flowed, encroaching upon the surrounding lands. Countless people lived at the foot of the mountains, boating for leisure, eating and drinking and raising children, living lives of great joy.

Yet above this expanse of mountains and desert floated a vast sea of clouds that blanketed the world, radiating an infinite treasure light. The colors of a Buddhist Land rose and fell within it, and one could vaguely discern lotus ponds and glazed steps, truly the image of a boundless paradise.

The Buddhists had Seven Aspects. Compassion had merged with the national destiny, and resided far to the north. The dharma realm had established a great mountain, sprawling across the center. And in the east, near the sea, lay the Paradise of Great Desire, which considered itself their equal and was known as the Eastern Paradise.

Upon the many tiers of glazed golden steps, one golden-skinned body after another could be seen, most wearing expressions of blissful joy. Thousands of monks were attached to these golden bodies, each reveling in their own pleasure.

On a golden platform to the south sat a figure, upright and proper. He was hideously ugly, with his skin was entirely golden, and his head was vaguely humanoid, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, with enormous black eyes. In his hand, he pinched a small, glaze-like stone, slowly bringing it to his mouth. Crushed powder spilled from his lips, causing the figures below to scramble for it in a frenzy.

Then, someone approached and called out,

"Mahasattva! Mahasattva! A fire has started in the west!"

This Maha straightened up. While forming a hand seal for a divine ability to gaze into the distance, he frowned.

"What damn fire?"

But that one look was all it took for his expression to change drastically. He cried out in horror,

"Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire?!"

He knew of this thing!

"Moongaze Lake! Li Ximing…"

As those words passed, an even more terrifying name flashed through his mind:

"Li Zhouwei."

The name made the Maha shoot to his feet, his eyes flickering with uncertainty.

This person was none other than Taixi!

Ever since this Maha of the Emptiness Dao had been defeated at Moongaze Lake and escaped with only a sliver of his True Spirit, he had hidden himself away in this paradise, never venturing out. Unexpectedly, after many years, his own Liangli had returned to the Buddhist Land and immediately driven him out, ordering him to deal with Mount Dayang.

After Taixi went out, he was terrified of being killed. He pulled many strings to clear the way, which was how he had come to the Emptiness Dao's backer, the Way of Great Desire, to cultivate temporarily.

And so, news from the outside world reached his ears, piece by piece.

The Great Song had crossed the river!

'Li Zhouwei has reached Jianghuai!'

'Vast Cicada is finished!'

When he heard of Guang Chan's fall, Taixi had already been filled with regret. By the time Qi Lanyan fell, his own injuries were mostly healed, but he had firmly decided not to go out again.

This lasted until the Great Tomb River was annihilated, and Renshijia, the high cultivator of the Buddhist Land whom he most admired, returned with only a fragment of his True Spirit, bringing with him news that was like the sky falling.

'A Great Daoist Master?'

'A Great Daoist Master who is just over a hundred years old!'

At that moment, Taixi knew the situation was dire.

'Back then, that… that Li Xuanfeng. I wanted to take him in but couldn't, so I gave him a quick death. Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing have always held a grudge against me. Now that he is a Great Daoist Master, how could he possibly let me off easy!'

Now, seeing the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire burning on the horizon, his heart turned to ice. Just then, a golden body emerged from the layers of clouds. Xiaodisa looked down at him from above.

"Taixi? Did you see the colors in the west?"

Xiaodisa's expression was stern. In his hands, he held an infant with thick eyebrows and large eyes. It was Renshijia, who had barely escaped with his life. He was hugging his knees, his head bowed, not uttering a word.

Taixi gritted his teeth.

"This humble monk has seen it…"

As soon as he spoke, the Merciful One should have stepped forth from below to curse the demonic presence, but the sea of clouds was utterly silent.

Xiaodisa, too, remained silent.

The Sea of Desire's Maha, Liangli Tian Langzhi, was away with his men, fighting for the Golden Land. The three most influential figures remaining in the Buddhist Land could only watch as the fire burned at their very doorstep, staring blankly at one another, each of them lowering their head.

"Ahem…"

Taixi could bear the silence no longer. He understood what the others wanted him to say, so he had no choice but to speak up.

"The great lord is at a critical juncture. The three Buddhist scions have been gestating for a long time. I implore you both not to act rashly…"

Ever since he had fled back from the west, Xiaodisa had cursed Li Zhouwei day and night, hating him to the bone. At this moment, however, all hatred was gone, his brow relaxed in acceptance. He unexpectedly expressed his approval for the Peacock faction's plan, declaring righteously,

"Fellow Daoist speaks with great virtue!"

Renshijia still did not reply. He was far more blunt than his junior brother. It took him a long moment to force out the words:

"The White Qilin is inhuman. We… will not provoke him… but how can we do nothing at all?"

Taixi pondered for a moment, then said suddenly,

"Why is it in the east?"

He and Xiaodisa exchanged a look, and both saw the delight in the other's eyes. He gritted his teeth.

"It's Lotus Temple again!"

"That bunch of useless trash, disregarding the greater good to chase profit and avoid harm!"

Xiaodisa raised his hand and cursed,

"This is clearly Lotus Temple deliberately indulging this! Why should we be the ones to go south and clean up their mess? I will write to Mount Dayang and lodge a damn complaint!"

"Precisely! Precisely!"

At once, the three began bustling—flicking sleeves, picking up brushes, each burying their head in their own task. The three great Mahas, the dominant figures of the Way of Great Desire, all spoke their minds freely. Even the infant-like Renshijia chattered away, saying only,

"It's those two, Minghui and Mingmeng, they're the most dishonest! Since Jinlian is away, what are they doing? Just sitting in their temple and waiting? We… would never deign to associate with such characters!"
