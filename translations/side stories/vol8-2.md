# Zaishi

O Sun, O Moon! Rising continually from the East.
O Father, O Mother—  
You nurtured me, yet left the task undone.  
How shall my fate be settled,  
When my destiny remains unspoken?

---

## One

He awoke from a hazy dream.

The wind and rain in the mountains were ethereal; green pines swayed in the forest, their needle-like leaves rustling—verdant and lush. All of it passed through that body of boundless divine power and into His ears, revealing the novelty of the outside world.

He heard a series of soft, scattered sounds, as if someone were laughing.

“Great Sage, you’ve arrived so late, only to ask Ancestral Master two questions? Won’t you stay in our temple for a few more days before returning to the Eastern Sea?”

Then He heard the Converging Water that was His body resonate with heaven and earth.

“So it’s fellow Daoist Ceyin… I had wished to ask a few more questions myself, but a sudden insight struck me, and my stomach churned unbearably. I can only think of finding a small meal to the northeast to fill my belly before I return to ask further about the Dao.”

That person laughed.

“I see… For the Great Sage to complete the seven-hundred-year Dao Embryo journey is a first-class achievement, even within our Profound Tradition. I also cultivate Water Virtue and had hoped to consult you about it, but I didn’t expect the Great Sage to be in such a hurry to leave.”

The Converging Water vibrated.

“Consult me? Are you mocking me, fellow Daoist? You too are one of the Overlooking Gaze Perceiving the Profound—what Dao theory could you possibly need from me? I only hope that when the day comes for me to seek the Dao from you, you will not refuse.”

“You speak too seriously, Great Sage.”

The person paused in thought before saying,

“I should have personally escorted you back to the Eastern Sea, but unfortunately, fellow Daoist Qu Da came to see me specifically. He claims to have obtained a rare treasure—colder than any Supreme Yin spiritual item—and insists I take a look at it…”

“How about this—I will have my disciple escort the Great Sage back.”

The Converging Water rippled continuously.

“Convey my regards to fellow Daoist Yu for me.”

And so, the sound of footsteps faded away, and a new voice spoke.

“Great Sage, if you please!”

“Why is it so lively outside?”

The young voice replied,

“The Great Sage may not know, but junior Martial Uncle Yuan has come to visit. He’s at the height of his fame and highly skilled in divination, so everyone below is surrounding him, asking about their futures.”

“Yuan…”

That voice savored the name for a moment, then laughed.

“You all have family names, but I am only ‘Great Sage.’ I once requested a surname from the great one and was given ‘Dongfang.’[^1] Since I dwell in the Eastern Sea, isn’t it perfectly fitting?”

The other person chuckled.

“I wonder—what given name did the Great Sage choose?”

That deep and resonant voice echoed through the mountain forest.

“A single character.”

“Jing.”

## Two

“Boom!”

The roar of the ocean and the thunder in the heavens intertwined. Across the boundless horizon reverberated a pale gray unique to the primordial past—resembling a gemstone swirled with azure and ash-white, utterly intoxicating to the soul.

He vaguely remembered that, back then, the sky was always veiled in gray, never as clear as the one above the great earth.

The sun and moon, heaven and earth, were never on their side.

His elder brother had once said that He bears the name _Rijiu_ in vain.

At the beginning of this memory, what He felt first was the vastness of Water Virtue. His consciousness had not come so late after all; back at Green Pine Temple, the moment that great one’s voice fell, the six of them, brothers all, each gained awareness.

In truth, they already had names then.

They were, respectively:

【Jia Ding】, 【Shen Guang】, 【Du Bing】, 【Xie】, 【Qishen】, and 【Hong】.

In the hazy confines of the womb, the six of them possessed bodies, but it was as if they were clad in robes far too tight, rendering them immobile. Jia Ding had not been so cold at first, growing steadier with each passing day. Later, when Pristine Water entered the Converging Water, their limbs were finally freed, and they formed pairs, dividing the world into three parts, creating distance between themselves. 

Only later did He realize that what separated them were their other three brothers.

In those days, heaven and earth expanded endlessly, forming a vast and limpid pool. It seemed there was another world beyond that pool—but though they were unwilling to leave, they heard someone laughing outside.

“Hey! Come early… come early! There are seats of the predecessors to be claimed out here!”

Jia Ding went first. He peered outside, sat down, and from then on became as vast as the sun and moon. One by one, they all went out, took their positions, and departed to amuse themselves. Only after their play was done did they see the man upon the sea—the very one who had called them to take their seats—and they thanked him in unison.

That person laughed.

“You shall all bear the surname Dongfang. As for your names… I shall bestow each in turn.”

They were arrogant by nature and only feigned a nod, paying it little heed. Only later did they regret not speaking up to contend for the first name. At the time, they knew no better; each held his seat and was too delighted to care whose was greater.

How vast and steady the heavens and earth were in those days… They had been born in the northeast corner of the sea. His four elder brothers were the livelier ones, chasing and roughhousing for three days and nights until they reached the southwest corner. The people and demons under heaven all looked up in admiration.

When they reached the edge of the world, Xie seemed to sense that the first to obey—Jia Ding—was more honored. He pulled Du Bing aside and said,

“That seat of yours looks quite comfortable. Let us have a turn sitting there sometime!”

He remembered his elder brother laughing in reply.

“Those who can sit will have their time to sit. I’m only afraid you won’t even sit securely in your own!”

## Three

A torrential downpour fell from the sky.

Endless lightning flashed across the horizon like the wrath of the heavens, coalescing in the distance into a bright, violet-white light. He still stood in that lofty position, but the smile on his face had turned into a placid iciness under the brilliant lightning. He stood upon the clouds, silently watching everything before him.

Beneath the lightning stretched a coiling, sprawling blackness—like a long, thin continent snaking across the sea’s surface under the flashes of lightning. The massive head that connected heaven and earth had its eyes tightly shut, tears of blood streaming down.

It was the corpse of a Hornless Dragon that spanned the heavens and the earth.

Xie.

This was the first lesson of Dao-accomplishment.

They had to be responsible for their words.

They were too young then, unaware of who stood outside that pool, nor did they understand the prestige of those positions. Later, Jia Ding orchestrated the upheaval of Pit-Mansion, and each of them took charge of river duties. The truth buried within the world became clearer and clearer. For that one sentence, Xie had hidden in the west and fled to the east for a thousand years, living in constant fear.

And Jia Ding…

He seized the position of First (Jiazi), entered the primary seat, and distributed the river duties. Yet everything was slipping away. He had become a Great Demon, and to take back that single jest from years ago, he ultimately forced his own brother—of the same flesh and blood—to his death.

"Boom!"

The lightning grew thicker; that divine thunder which vanquished demons and suppressed evil became even more terrifying. The aura of Water Virtue plummeted, replaced by a world filled with the light of thunder, as if something fundamental had changed.

But the eldest son of the True Hornless Dragon did not care.

And He… finally understood as well.

“They say Jia Ding is becoming more and more like Father.”

“Xie is only the first.”

Everything about that fallen True Hornless Dragon seemed to be erasing itself from the world, while the Converging Water around the Dragon Monarch high above grew even more dazzling, faintly suffused with lightning. Exiled Qi filled the heavens, its flashes illuminating His body.

Looking at the True Hornless Dragon of Converging Water standing between Heaven and Earth, His gaze grew ever colder.

“Jia Ding!”

But there was no response from the unchanging Great Void. He saw the Converging Water that spanned the world slowly recede into the violent lightning. Then he heard the faint voice of that eldest son of the True Hornless Dragon.

“This venerable one is called…”

“Dongfang Rijiu.”

## Four

He was no longer that Jia Ding.

He was Dongfang Rijiu.

"One day, Dongfang Rijiu… will force us to our deaths, one by one…"

"He will slowly… devour us."

His voice echoed in the infinite darkness. The voice at the other end, nearly identical, sneered in reply.

"But he isn’t the only one who can wield a name. He can devour Qishen, but he cannot devour Dongfang Zaishi. He can scheme against Hong until his death, but he cannot kill Dongfang Tianye."

"However, he never had the chance to prove it. In the end, he died."

Within the darkness, there seemed to exist a great sea, its surface shimmering faintly. He stood with his hands behind his back, his shadow pouring down like a waterfall. His voice was remarkably calm, even filled with a sense of judgment.

"After all, it was that man surnamed Qin. In terms of sheer destructive power, he could rival the Three Profundity Masters. Dongfang Rijiu was capable, but he was ultimately fated to fall."

The other voice replied evenly, "But his death was not in vain. It was a magnificent death. The river duties… truly a feat to shake the world…"

He laughed softly. "Dongfang Rijiu set a grand precedent, letting the world know of walking the waters. The rivers—the Jiang, He, Ji, and Huai… these four great rivers form the foundation of Pit Water. As long as one walks the waters and occupies one of them, it’s possible to emulate his accomplishment of becoming the First…"[^1]

"And so Xie was the first to fall. His death was no mere fall, but utter annihilation. His very existence was erased from the mortal realm by Dongfang Rijiu, along with that one Surplus Position. And so, the Huai River ceased to flow…"

"He called this… a meritorious deed. As long as the Hornless Dragon’s cycle suppresses the Pit Water, his influence upon the world will never fade… Beginning with Xie, we all witnessed Dongfang Rijiu’s ambition."

"You and I arrived late and did not obtain one of the four great rivers, taking only the Ying and Yi… so we were not regarded highly by him."

"However—"

He murmured,

"Now… I must thank him. If he hadn’t annihilated Xie, one of the four great rivers—the Huai—would not be vacant… it wouldn’t have given us this opportunity we have now."

"It is an opportunity—and also a Dao contention."

But the figure in the darkness rolled over lazily and said,

"Dongfang Zaishi."

"This venerable one wants to try… without permitting your contention, can this venerable one still win?"

Within this echoing memory, he could already sense the boundless lightning and fire beyond the darkness—like venomous snakes, like a great net—closing in from afar to kill him.

## Five

"This was the Dao-contention between myself and Dongfang Tianye."

At long last, the myriad visions ceased their descent into eternal darkness. The primordial light of water drifted over. He stood in this infinitely hidden grotto-heaven, his expression placid and cold.

All manner of divine abilities lay dormant in the river-like cave dwelling. This frail human body was truly laughable, making Him extremely uncomfortable, but He ignored it all and murmured,

"The time is now."

The woman behind him stood quietly and said, "You want to walk the waters and seize the Huai."

He spoke softly "Of course I do."

The woman raised her brow and looked at Him, at this somewhat frail human form standing amidst the shimmering waters of this world.

"During the Zhou era… I was cultivating on the upper reaches of the Great River, accumulating water potential, intending to walk its course. I was at Gyaring Lake, and he, Dongfang Tianye, was at Ngoring Lake… He knew we were destined for a conflict and compromised with the Thunders and Radiant Fire, striking me down and killing me upon Gyaring Lake."

Colors swirled in His eyes, as if the cataclysmic scene was replaying itself—the shaking of thunder, the surging of Radiant Fire. He murmured,

"That pain was immense… They destroyed my body and destroyed my Dao-fruit, and still they pursued my very life-mandate. Fortunately… fortunately, I had once saved Wei Buyi on the Weak Water, and 【Cejin】 came to honor his oath…"

"He transformed into an old fisherman, casting his net in the Weak Water. He stuffed me into his fish basket, then took another fish, blew on it to create a new Dongfang Zaishi, and thus I escaped one calamity… Waiting until the thunder dissipated and the fire scattered, he placed the fish basket into the setting waters and said coldly, 【I grant you several thousand more years of carefree wandering. The debt between the Wei clan and you is cleared】!"

"I… Dongfang Zaishi, have been cultivating in that fish basket within the Weak Water ever since."

This Dragon Monarch gave a slight smile, "Actually… I believe I could call you junior martial sister."

The woman's figure was shrouded in layers of gray water, at times clear, at times indistinct. There was no surprise in her voice, nor did she reply to that, only a stretch of calm. "And so your life-mandate is no longer pure, and you have lost the chance to walk the waters."

"Having Dongfang Tianye is enough."

He did not care about her lack of acknowledgment, gazing forward as his voice began to tremble softly.

"Xuan'nu… do you know… what the great one said back then?"

The woman finally revealed a sliver of pale blue light from her eyes in the deep darkness. She stared at the Hornless Dragon before her, watching him step forward as if possessed, sitting cross-legged in the air, smiling as he looked upon it all.

"The Sun and Moon originate from the east... You... sought the first and obtained the first... so you are called Rijiu. You... shall hide your name within the Jiang... so you are called Yuezhu..."[^2]

His shadow was cast upon the stone wall, faintly tinged with green, and one could vaguely see him raise his hand, as if pointing to the formless, colossal figures beside him one by one.

"And you… appearing at a time neither bright nor dark, are best called Weiming."[^3]

"Not yet its time… not yet its time! You shall be called Weixi."[^4]

His voice grew louder and louder, tinged with a crazed laughter.

"As for you two, one's body is a chamber, the other's body is his work; there will be a contention between you. You shall be called Zaishi… and you… shall be called Tianye."[^5]

## Six

"So… that's how the name Dongfang Zaishi came to be."

The shimmering light of water rippled before his eyes, and the waterfalls of the world thundered. He stood upon that great land, the woman behind him with her back to him, a shadow as ethereal as mist.

"Yes," he said, entranced. "This venerable one is called… Dongfang Zaishi."

"They obtained their positions and went off to the edge of the heavens, roughhousing and playing. We guarded the pool, never imagining that the pool itself would also come alive. Back then, we lived in pairs, so there were three additional Pristine Water brothers. They also called themselves Dongfang, and, lamenting that they had not received names, made their own…"

On his face, where the features were blurred and indistinct, sharp teeth seemed to glint as he murmured,

"Dongfang Fengchi was born between Rijiu and Yuezhu and considered himself a cut above, calling himself Fengchi. Tianye lost to him, stepped back a position, and willingly acknowledged him as an elder brother."

"Look at that. Even Dongfang Tianye has such a foolish side. In truth, it's hard to say. Among us, perhaps there was genuine feeling in the beginning, but we didn't know that some words cannot be spoken. And so it has come to this day."

He stared ahead somewhat dazedly. The woman beside him spoke quietly:

"Dongfang Tianye is about to begin walking the waters."

But the True Monarch before her seemed not to hear. He said softly,

"Did you know, the six of us brothers form three pairs? I have seen it clearly now. The prophecies that great one spoke were few, and even fewer from the ancient past, but eight out of ten would come true. In the end, people even suspected that the remaining two weren't wrong—only that their time had not yet come, and we simply could not understand."

"That great one said… Tianye and I are destined for contention, so it will surely happen."

He murmured,

"That is why I was able to find a path of survival amidst the thunder and fire. Thinking back, my saving Wei Buyi might have been Azure Profundity giving me a chance. Given my own notorious past, Cejin probably wouldn't have remembered my kindness otherwise."

The rumbling sound of water echoed. The woman could be seen faintly clasping her hands together. She spoke in a tone that was both a question and a statement.

"What does the Dragon Monarch intend to do?"

Dongfang Zaishi raised his head and said softly, "I am going to destroy everything he has."

"Back then, Dongfang Rijiu could kill Xie and use one of the nine sons as a meritorious deed, so why can't I? Filling the vastness… filling the vastness is nothing more than causing a overflow."

"He wants to carry the surging river water into the Huai, seizing its river duties while achieving convergence. But if I cause his thousand-mile river to burst its banks in one place, is that not also a form of violent overflow?"

The corner of his mouth curved up as he spoke faintly.

"He wants to gain merit and achieve convergence. I possess the Weak Water—so why can't I use him as a meritorious deed and ascend to the Pit Water?"

He stared at the world, with only the endless Valley Water spreading behind him.

"As long as… as long as you… hide me afterward."

The woman stood sideways behind him, saying nothing, but behind her was an endless, bottomless gray, like a great net woven long ago—ready to swallow everything and hide it within the bottomless Valley Water.

"Alright."

## Seven

As the rumbling sound of water brewed on the high plateau, He drove his frail body forward, walking across the vast land.

Countless displaced people moved across the plains like thousands of ant-like black dots. Among them, he saw a man on horseback emerge from the dark masses, his body adorned with colorful bird feathers.

The man appeared lean, his skin slightly dark. As heaven and earth tore asunder, he reined in his horse and stood still upon the land. In the distance, Hornless Dragons and Flood Dragons rapidly approached—the thundering roar of water threatened the end of the world—yet he simply stood there.

A massive trench lay before the man. The long canal, built during the Zhou era and later carved deeper by the tail of a Hornless Dragon, was bottomless—like the gaping maw of an abyss.

“What is this place?” the man asked.

Another figure in armor emerged from behind him, a white light flickering around his body like a meteor shower.

“Great King, this is the Great Canal! This place is too deep... Some say its bottom leads straight to the Underworld.”

The man lifted his head, gazing into the howling wind, driving rain, and roaring flood in the distance. The rain matted his hair into wet strands, and a smile appeared on his bearded, disheveled face.

He turned to another man and said, "The teacher said... Profound Qi is a calamity... I wonder where it will manifest?”

That man laughed. “Profound is disaster and calamity; it is to attain what one does not deserve, to seek what is incomplete. One who overcomes the profound gains the mandate. It is also slaughter and suppression, punishment for those who seize position without integrity, who ascend without virtue. One who tames the profound brings order to the world.”

Amidst the roaring rain, the man’s body suddenly grew infinitely large. Billowing black smoke coiled around him, forming a barrier that spanned heaven and earth. He laughed heartily.

“The nine sons of the True Hornless Dragon are worthy of me, Tuoba Xuantan, facing them as calamity itself!”

_Boom!_

World-shaking thunder turned the sky into a dense, sprawling purple. The emperor who had emerged from the crowd now stood upon the horizon, using his own body to block the two Hornless Dragon horns, causing the earth to wail in mournful cries.

The iron-like fists of that dharma body clenched tight, releasing waves of bone-etching black smoke. A phoenix–qilin behemoth stretched its limbs within the roiling clouds, only to be eroded by a formless light of water.

Heaven and earth went dark; the sun and moon lost their light.

_Boom!_

Thunder resounded once more. From the darkness, a young man finally appeared, step by step. He lifted his gaze to the sky, dense scales spreading across his face as the powerful body of a Hornless Dragon burst forth from his human form. His life-mandate burned brightly in the world, erupting as a sound that pierced the heavens.

Hornless Dragon!

In an instant, the roiling winds and clouds across the world reversed. That fierce and vicious tail swept down with a deafening crash, smashing into the surging river. Responding to the life-mandate call of a fellow son of Converging Water, the already strained and precarious Converging Water finally collapsed with a thunderous roar!

A furious and wretched howl echoed through the world.

“Dongfang... Zaishi!”

## Eight

"The world has suffered under the Hornless Dragons for too long! Today, I slay one to affirm my imperial position!"

The rushing river tumbled across the land, and a faint outline of a silver robe could vaguely be seen drifting on the river's surface. The roiling, dragon-like river began to converge, and a silvery light shone down from the clouds.

A rain of blood fell from the sky. He stood in the midst of it all, slowly raising His head, feeling the blood and rain on His face, and sensing the position of Converging Water that He now trod underfoot.

"You are called Tuoba Xuantan…"

He looked at the emperor standing on the Hornless Dragon's corpse with some emotion in His heart, but none of it mattered anymore. The billowing light of Water Virtue wrapped around Him, lifting Him into the sky, farther and farther away from the earth.

'The body of 【Hong】 belongs to you… his life-mandate… belongs to me!'

The life-mandate of His kin was brazenly devoured by Him. The Converging Water began to resonate within His body. He looked down upon the world with a mocking gaze.

"Once the great waters overflow, I shall be able to ascend to the Pit Water!"

Dongfang Tianye was already dead. The out-of-control river roared across the land, yet it did not gush forth to span the heavens but instead slowly contracted under a giant shadow cast upon the ground, flowing north along the turbulent river channel toward a distant place.

"The Ji River… 【Du Bing】…"

He raised His head and smiled.

"No, that's not right. I should call you…"

"Dongfang Weiming."

This third son of the Hornless Dragon had arrived late, intercepting the Dao-fruit that Dongfang Tianye had failed to complete, and in doing so, shattered all of His grand momentum.

Now, the Pit Water was nothing more than a deluge that merely resembled Converging.

The Dao-work of Dongfang Tianye that He had destroyed did not result in a world-inundating flood that overturned the nine provinces. His momentum dropped precipitously, but the Dao-fruit of a thousand years of cultivation still supported Him, and the protection of Cejin still provided Him with crucial legitimacy.

He could still aim for the Intercalary Position!

But at this moment, everything He had swallowed began to churn within Him. The master of that Converging Water position began to awaken. Dongfang Tianye's shadow, like a Yin Shade, flickered across His face—the Converging Water He had swallowed was too, too strong. Without ascending to the primary seat, He could not suppress the consumed Dongfang Tianye…

However, at this moment, He laughed without a care in the world.

"Dongfang Weiming… I know you're there."

"Hong ignored you and recklessly walked the waters because you were sowing discord, leaving a path of retreat for Him… and that path of retreat was to come and contend for my incomplete Dao-fruit…"

There was no resentment in His heart, no anger at being schemed against, but rather an infinite joy, and His tone even grew sarcastic.

"So that's how it is… so Dongfang Tianye… you actually… also believed we were destined for a contention…"

"Destined for a contention… this is what it means to be destined for a contention."

His cheeks began to split apart. A Hornless Dragon's head burst ferociously from half of His face, as if a demonic Hornless Dragon were lurking under His skin, revealing a scale here, a claw there, or extending its tail to coil around His body again and again.

"You and I… are contending for this one Dao-fruit…"

## Nine

His body flew higher and higher, plunging into the infinite darkness, back to the refuge he had hidden for many years.

This place was not like a grotto-heaven, nor was it beyond the sky. It was infinitely black here, the horizon a crisscrossing mesh of black, like a dense basket's weave, through which the white of the outside world could be faintly seen.

This place seemed to offer infinite peace of mind, just as when he had fled into it with only his life-mandate remaining, even as the endless tearing had driven him to the brink of insanity. At this moment, he began to laugh wildly as he tumbled through the air.

"But I will definitely win! I have long awaited this day!"

"You… Dongfang Tianye… I… Dongfang Zaishi…"

"One's body as a chamber, the other's as his work; there will be a contention!"

Hornless Dragon scales and dharma blood flew everywhere, the dense Pit Water enveloping him. Metallic Essence and life-mandate intertwined brilliantly, as if validating his Dao-fruit. In this place, trapped in a desperate situation, He grew inexplicably stronger, the radiance of his life-mandate reaching its zenith.

"Dongfang Tianye!"

"You were deceived by Xuan'nu and Dongfang Weiming!"

"You were born to complete my work, to become my meritorious deed, and I… I am the one destined to be the chamber…"

Endless light from the water filled the space, transforming into wisps of gray. The voice of the Hornless Dragon lineage was frenzied, echoing in every corner.

"It will be me… Dongfang Zaishi!"

The moon has always been closely associated with water — as in the saying, “The Moon hides in the Water.” Unlike the sun, the moon does not produce its own light; it merely reflects it. In this sense, it "hides" its true body in the darkness of space while casting its luminous image upon the river’s surface.
