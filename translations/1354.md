# Chapter 1354: Vast Plateau

Spiritual light converged at the horizon amid tangled layers of cloud and mist. Countless ropes of flowing light descended like a thousand tassels, and soon, a golden radiance emerged from the white clouds, riding a current of white energy as it drifted across the sky.

A Daoist Master stood upon the white cloud. He had the refined appearance of a profound scholar, and his robes were exceptionally simple. He traveled in haste, soon landing at a small mountain temple to rest for a moment before speaking to an attendant.

"Lu Fu, a descendant of the Lu clan, has come to pay his respects. Please announce my arrival."

The man complied respectfully and quickly came to lead him up the mountain, step by step. The mountain forests grew steadily denser until they entered a courtyard where a young man was waiting.

Above them, two Daoists in Feathered Robes were discussing the profound. One of them turned to the side and said with a smile,

"You would be Wu Qingyan, correct? I heard my disciple-brother mention you. I wonder how my little martial nephew is doing these days?"

The young man hurriedly reported, "Ever since he arrived in our Myriad-Prosperity Heaven, His Lordship personally arranged his reincarnation. He has entered a sect and now cultivates the Dao by ingesting qi. Although he has not yet awakened the memories of his past life, he is exceptionally clever and well-behaved. Martial Uncle Wang is also very fond of him!"

Lu Fu heard this and was secretly amazed.

He was here to report news from Chun City on behalf of his clan. He hadn't been the original choice for the task, but after suffering two consecutive calamities and nearly being left behind on Mount Jiao with Wen Daoping, he began to suspect his fate was afflicted by the Bright Yang. He had specifically requested this assignment to distance himself from the mortal world.

'I wonder whose direct descendant he is, a noble from which Daoist tradition. To be reincarnated is one thing, but to be reincarnated into the Myriad-Prosperity Heaven of all places!'

The Myriad-Prosperity Heaven was not a place one could enter at will. This treasured land of True Monarch Xu Xiang had always been reclusive and aloof. It was said that a great personage resided within, and though his condition was not good, he was at the Golden Core level at the very least! It was just that He did not communicate with the outside world. Even with the means of reincarnation, one was expected to leave after completing repairing their body and inheriting the Myriad-Prosperity Daoist tradition. Remaining inside to cultivate was no simple feat!

As expected, the questioner above seemed quite satisfied and said, "Fellow Daoist Wang is truly capable. This time, Xuanlou owes him a favor. Has your master been well lately?"

The youth below smiled. "His Lordship has been the same for a thousand years; there is no good or ill to speak of. He follows the venerable one's command to remain isolated from the outside world. It's just that Martial Uncle Wang made a trip to the outside world and returned quite changed, which has led to His Lordship waking more frequently."

The conversation was then taken over by Yao Guanyi, who stated, "After the matter of the Great Tomb River, someone from the Qing clan came to the mountain and brought treasures for each of us. Other things aside, the treasures are all genuine foundational treasures."

The courtyard had fallen silent. Everyone held their breath, gazing at him. Yao Guanyi's voice was perfectly calm.

"Sandalwood Forest also sent two Dharma Aspects: one renowned throughout the world for his profound stratagems, the 【Right Seat Profound Stratagem All-Hearing Dharma Aspect】, and one who commands a thunderous golden body, the 【Golden Body Thunder Sound Flawless Dharma Idol】. They waited before the 【Wu Profound Heaven】."

Daoist Master Xu, who was beside him, finally showed a change in expression and asked softly, "Did... His Lordship see them?"

Yao Guanyi shook his head, his expression complicated.

"Of course not. Although His Lordship accepted a debt of gratitude from the Dams Goat, he has never been willing to meet these later-generation Dharma Aspects. I heard from my Martial Uncle that they waited for a good while, presented their missives, and only then departed."

Daoist Master Xu visibly relaxed. Yao Guanyi slowly raised his head, his face serene as he continued, 

"And within my Comprehending Profundity, all seventeen Daoist traditions of the various paths, the seven manifest worlds, and the six paths of the old palace have all responded in concert. The Wandering, Azure Revolution, Numinous Treasure, and Purple Terrace have all come to offer congratulations."

He said, "In addition, Outside the Profound's Penglai, the Xie clan of Qinghuan, and the Feather-Shedding Land have each sent representatives..."

"Of course."

Yao Guanyi gave a complicated smile. "There is also 【Awaiting Clarity】."

He was clearly responding to the one from Numinous Treasure, yet everyone around was listening in secret.

Daoist Master Xu murmured, "No matter what, the Three Profundities... share a single roof. Although it doesn't compare to the grand state of ancient times... there should still be some sentiment between us."

He spoke the words, but no one in the vicinity responded. Even Yao Guanyi, seated opposite him, kept his eyelids lowered and did not speak. The unspoken meaning was already obvious.

After a long while, the youth from Myriad-Prosperity Heaven who was kneeling on the ground raised his head. His face was calm, but his voice was light and ethereal.

"Things have become far too unsightly."

He was, after all, someone who lived year-round in his own grotto-heaven and possessed considerable courage. It was fitting that such a statement came from his mouth. Everyone present was shocked, yet they all lowered their gazes and said nothing.

Without even mentioning distant matters... just look at Wanling and Anhuai recently... If you were to ask about the 【Sheji Apostasy】, which cultivator from Encompassing Profundity wouldn't grit their teeth in anger?

But with the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition in seclusion for many years, the identity of the instigator behind this 'unsightly' affair... was also glaringly obvious. Yao Guanyi lowered his gaze deferentially, feigning deafness, and replied,

"The Guanmiao Attendant Spirit is an exceedingly noble personage. A few years ago, I went to the temple to pay my respects and offered incense to Him. I discussed it with my junior disciple-brothers and sisters. He is one of the rare few who can sit there, a living being in attendance..."

He paused, then said, "It is still the same offer... as long as His Lordship is willing to enter the world, several True Monarchs will personally come to invite Him, complete His immortal body, and treat Him with the courtesy due to an elder."

"This junior will deliver the message..." the youth replied with courteous formality. "However, it is, after all, the Ancestral Master's command."

Lu Fu's heart pounded as he listened. The Lu clan was certainly glorious, but the two famous Lu ancestors of old had not achieved the rank of True Monarch. After so many generations of inheritance, how could they have the chance to casually overhear these pleasantries between Daoist traditions that had manifest True Monarchs? He couldn't help but feel a surge of envy.

'A Guanmiao Attendant Spirit... if my Lu clan had such a figure backing us, I could be like that Wang Ziya and leave with a flick of my sleeves... How could I have ended up captured by the Bright Yang twice...'

The person above said, "This Yao understands. Since Martial Nephew Wu is out and about, please rest well here in the 【Vast Plateau Heaven】 for now..."

The youth exchanged a few more pleasantries and quickly withdrew. Only then did Lu Fu step forward, bow before the courtyard, and say respectfully, "Greetings, Your Lordship!"

"You are too kind!"

The man above had sharp brows and bright eyes, a broad face, and wide shoulders. Dressed in a yellow and white Daoist robe, he smiled and said, "The two Lus were Great Virtues of Comprehending Profundity. In those days, several True Monarchs had to address them as disciple-brother. This Guanyi cannot bear such a title."

He raised an eyebrow and asked with great interest, "What is the news?"

Lu Fu quickly presented the scroll his elder brother had given him. The scroll was densely covered in characters, transcribing the exact words from each clan. After Yao Guanyi finished reading it in detail, the corners of his mouth curved upward into a smile.

"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!"

He repeated 'excellent' three times before continuing, "Pang Yi is truly a rare talent!"

Yao Guanyi stood up, looking refreshed and invigorated. He paced back and forth in the hall and actually began to laugh. 

"Longkang Yao is a capable man. Though arrogant and conceited, as a direct descendant of Blazing Aridity Heaven who has cultivated to the level of a Great Daoist Master, he is already considered quite exceptional within the Longkang clan. To scheme against such a person, one must naturally be prepared for the consequences of giving offense!"

His laughter was filled with an indescribable measure of malicious glee and relief, causing everyone in the hall to lower their heads. Not a single person dared to look up and agree with him.

Only the Daoist Master Xu sitting opposite him shook his head and sighed.

"Guanyi... now they have confirmed it as well."

Yao Guanyi finally stopped laughing and nodded nonchalantly.

"Correct. Li Zhouwei must have a Heavenly Element in his possession!"

Daoist Master Xu mulled it over for a moment. "Thinking about it now, they must have suspected for a long time. All those changes, Vast Cicada, the Salt Lake... they just couldn't confirm it. After all, those things could have been a warning from someone in the south..."

"But now, with the timing of this Heavenly Element and the urgency of this secret affair, seeing Li Ximing rush back so hastily from the lake makes it obvious. It's just... I never expected..."

"I never expected the consequences would be so tragic!"

Yao Guanyi gave a cold laugh. "They all saw it clearly. They were going to offend Blazing Aridity one way or another. Now, they can spin the fact that their attempt to harm him failed into a narrative where no harm was done at all. That way, they'll have an excuse to give Blazing Aridity Heaven. At most, Longkang Yao will be displeased, but what can he do? In a while, he'll return to his grotto-heaven. If he's unhappy, then so be it!"

He raised a hand, filled his own teacup, and said coolly, "But they didn't expect... Longkang Yao does not have shallow bloodlines, and his destiny is not insignificant. He is, after all, the descendant of a True Monarch who changed his position. He was already difficult to control, and then the Bright Yang fanned the flames and used that surprise weapon, the Pang clan. Of course Fu Tanjian miscalculated."

Below, Lu Fu was both shocked and terrified. He lowered his head and pretended not to hear. Daoist Master Xu glanced at him discreetly and said, "Little friend Lu, you may withdraw for now."

Everyone in the courtyard dispersed, leaving only Wu Qingyan standing impassively to one side. Only then did Daoist Master Xu turn his head. He watched Yao Guanyi fill his cup and said gravely, "You suspected this long ago..."

Yao Guanyi replied faintly, "I did."

Daoist Master Xu seemed to recall something. He looked at Yao Guanyi with dawning realization and said probingly,

"That's right. There have been instances of a Heavenly Element manifesting externally before. Back then, it didn't cause such a commotion, nor was the news spread everywhere. It seems someone even entered the path of Comprehending Profundity and achieved the Dao..."

Yao Guanyi said, "Correct. Heavenly Element scions are certainly rare, but I am familiar with them. With the generations of experience the fox-kin have cultivating the 『Heaven–Governing』, it's not impossible for one to have landed on the lake..."

Daoist Master Xu considered this. "I remember... there was a Liu Changdie..."

"Back then, his origins were unknown, and he was neither kin nor friend. Why should we have intervened? What harm was there in fanning the flames? But now, Heavenly Elements are appearing everywhere, and we've managed to secure one for our own use. How can you even compare the two situations?", Yao Guanyi replied.

Daoist Master Xu did not reply, still half-believing and half-doubting. Yao Guanyi had already risen to his feet. He took a long silk scroll from his sleeve, holding one end and unrolling the other to reveal it was covered in dense text.

He smiled. "I haven't suspected this for just a day or two. Unfortunately, there are too many people at the lake, making it difficult to confirm. It would also be ill-advised for our own people to go and become entangled in karma..."

His gaze swept quietly over the names, lingering for a moment on the last one or two.

"It is actually quite obvious already..." he said softly.

He fell silent, then suddenly turned his head. Only then did he notice Wu Qingyan waiting quietly in the courtyard. He smiled.

"Qingyan, you are..."

Wu Qingyan said with a solemn expression, "Having heard about the events at the Great Tomb River, His Lordship... is very concerned!"

While it was true that Wang Ziya had fought hard for Wu Qingyan to make this trip, it was also a reflection of that Dao Court Emissary, the Guanmiao Attendant Spirit's, own deep-seated curiosity and desire to discreetly inquire about the matter of the Great Tomb River!

"That is perfectly normal..."

The man above clasped his hands and said softly, "In the world today, there isn't a single power that isn't concerned about the events on the Great Tomb River. Even the Wandering Metal have been sighted. How could the Daoist traditions in their various grotto-heavens remain quiet? letters communicating between them must have piled up into mountains!"

He smiled. "This Guanyi humbly cultivates at the Purple Terrace, and not a few have written to ask me about it. Furthermore, my ancestor once cultivated within Myriad-Prosperity, so that connection can certainly not be ignored. Since His Lordship wishes to know, I shall speak of it."

Yao Guanyi sighed, his voice growing quieter.

"Valley Water is injured; there is nothing more to be said about that. Xiao Chuting..."

When mentioning this Great Daoist Master who had fought his way from the mortal world to stand before the True Monarchs, Yao Guanyi showed him ample respect.

He paused before continuing, "Although he has fallen, his death has dragged many things into the light. At the very least, there is still that True Monarch from Cangzhou..."

He gave a slight smile. "Let us just call him a True Monarch for now..."

Evidently, not many within this grotto-heaven knew of that True Monarch Xuan Cang. Every face was filled with confusion. 

Daoist Master Wu stepped forward and said respectfully, "This junior has also heard of him... Even my master is unaware of his origins..."

Yao Guanyi's expression turned serious. "A day ago, Resplendent Monarch Zhenxuan went out to preach the Dharma. My Martial Uncle made a special trip to ask him and was only then able to obtain some news. Since it is the Attendant Spirit asking, it is only natural that this junior should answer."

His gaze was complex as he said, "My Martial Uncle is favored by him, so upon being asked, that lord recreated the scene from that time. That great personage's true body transformed into boundless Pit Water, bearing the aura of Dao-contention... and it was coiled with a Hornless Dragon."

"Coiled with a Hornless Dragon?!"

Daoist Master Xu's pupils instantly dilated. He looked up, murmuring incoherently.

Wu Qingyan was even more stunned as he stared and repeated, "A Hornless Dragon?"

Yao Guanyi sighed. "He killed a Hornless Dragon, one of the nine sons, and wears it upon his back to display his achievement."

In that instant, the spiritual vitality surged as if a waterfall were about to crash down, only to be blocked by the grotto-heaven's heavy protections and suppressed by the immortal traces left upon the mountain. Wu Qingyan's face turned pale in a flash.

"One of the nine sons? How is that possible!"

Xu Jiaoyan's voice was strained. "Fellow Daoist Yao! What are you saying? To put it bluntly, the minds of the Hornless Dragon lineage are smaller than the eye of a needle. In this day and age, how could anyone possibly wear one of the nine sons as a trophy? It's unheard of!"

"Furthermore, we have watched the changes in the world. This great personage must stand on the side of the Dragon-kin. Back then, the Liang dynasty was responsible for the death of Dongfang Tianye, and in the end, the Liang Emperor himself had to die by drowning. If something like this were true, they would surely retaliate with the full might of their clan. How could they possibly be allies?"

Yao Guanyi raised his cup, allowing the two of them a moment to digest their shock before he said faintly, "What you say is correct."

He paused for a moment, then changed the subject for some unknown reason, smiling as he asked,

"How many of the nine sons still remain... does fellow Daoist know?"

Xu Jiaoyan answered without hesitation, "This was a matter settled long ago, deduced by the great ones of the past through Daoist debates. Of the nine sons, only two remain... It was only later that Dragon Monarch Xiyang was added..."

His words trailed off, and he stared at the other man in disbelief. Yao Guanyi rose to his feet and said softly,

"An ordinary True Monarch would, of course, have no way to slay one of the nine sons and wear its body..."

"But what if..."

"This great personage was himself one of the nine sons back then—a Dragon Monarch?"
