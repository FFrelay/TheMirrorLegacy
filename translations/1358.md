# Chapter 1358: Sacred Scrolls

Li Ximing realized who stood before him, and a wave of heat surged through his body. Countless thoughts raced through his mind, threatening to shatter his spiritual sense.

"This is bad!"

He sensed that something was amiss. Yet at this critical moment, the Talisman Seed—which had always resided within his Shengyang Acupoint, using its cooling properties to dispel tribulations—failed to respond. Instead, it flared as if provoked, and a torrent of Bright Yang’s mysteries erupted from within, completely clouding his spiritual sense.

A drowsy, hazy sensation spread through his mind, transforming into a raging fire that thrashed about wildly. A coppery sweetness rose in his throat, as if he were about to vomit blood.

At this crucial juncture, a secret art suddenly ignited within his spiritual sense, jolting him awake. Li Ximing could no longer afford to hesitate; with a flick of his sleeve, an object resembling a sheepskin scroll appeared in his hand.

For a brief moment, a brilliant golden light flashed—

The Secret Art of Shouyi’s Attainment!

Back then, the Li clan had obtained this Secret Art of Shouyi’s Attainment, also known as the _Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment_, from the Buddhist monk Mingmeng. It was a supreme and wondrous technique once bestowed upon the great King Shouyi by the Wei Emperor himself.

Li Ximing and the others had long recognized it as an exceptionally profound spell art, but they were vexed by the lack of a specific visualization method and had been forced to set it aside like a mere decoration. Now, upon suddenly beholding the image of the Bright Yang Monarch, a moment of profound enlightenment dawned upon him. The scroll reacted on its own as dense golden characters materialized within, coalescing into infinitesimally small specks of light that cascaded into him like a waterfall.

In an instant, those countless thoughts and searing intents seemed to find an outlet, stirring his divine abilities to flicker incessantly between light and shadow. Li Ximing sat upright in a daze, suspended between the two like a bridge, his heart awash with a whirlwind of mixed emotions.

An unknown length of time passed before he abruptly opened his eyes and exhaled a long breath of turbid air. He sat motionless for a while, as if a lifetime had passed. The _Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment_ that had been in his hand was now nowhere to be found.

"So that’s how it is!"

He sat quietly for a long time before finally opening his palm.

There, in his fair palm, was a single golden dot, as if painted with gold lacquer—mesmerizing to behold. Gazing at it intently, one could almost see the various scenes of the pavilion reflected in its depths.

_The Secret Art of Shouyi’s Attainment… visualization complete!_

Li Ximing released a long breath, his heart pounding.

"So that’s how it is!"

The _Scroll of Accomplishment and Fulfillment_ had never been incomplete. Anything bestowed by the Wei Emperor was either utterly destroyed or retained its divine power—it was never left half-finished. The reason this scroll lacked a visualization chart was due to the Bright Yang Monarch’s decree: unless one beheld Bright Yang himself, completion was impossible.

Now, stimulated by this painting, its true marvel finally revealed itself, manifesting as a golden dot in his palm. Li Ximing clutched it like a priceless treasure, brought his hands together, and the golden dot transferred seamlessly to his other hand.

"It’s still the same scroll… it’s simply become far more miraculous."

With just a glance, Li Ximing saw profound inscriptions in golden seal script and countless Daoist texts of unfathomable mystery, filling him with joy.

_Zhouwei still lacks several techniques… this will be perfect for him._

After this experience, Li Ximing felt as if he had swallowed a spirit pill—his entire being radiated heat from within. Gazing once more at the myriad heavenly lights, he found his understanding transformed.

He hurriedly bowed in gratitude. When he looked up again, the painting had lost all brilliance, appearing as nothing more than an ordinary ancient scroll.

He lowered his gaze to the altar table below, where an empty bronze plate and dust-covered candle holders lay. Several incense burners stood dark and unlit.

_The Bright Yang Dao-path… has been vacant for many years…_

Li Qianyuan had once been a True Monarch of the Three Yangs Dao, a figure who had dominated an entire era. Yet the fall of Wei was like a collapsing mountain, leaving him coldly neglected in this pavilion, without even a stick of incense offered in his name.

Li Ximing sighed softly.

_It makes sense. It is said he “scourged the world’s cultivators and laid waste to three thousand two hundred sects.” Although ‘sects’ is a general term, mostly referring to minor Daoist traditions, given his temperament, how could he have spared the aristocratic families of Gu Prefecture…_

_Now that the Bright Yang Daoist tradition has been severed… I fear the families within still harbor resentment toward him, so naturally, there are no offerings._

He sighed softly, his feelings inevitably complex, for he had just received a great favor from the man. Reaching into his sleeve, he took out several spirit fruits and spiritual items, placing them one by one on the bronze plate and arranging them neatly.

He did not truly believe that Li Zhouwei’s Bright Yang was necessarily of the Wei-Li bloodline, yet it was, after all, his Daoist lineage. Taking out three sticks of incense from his sleeve, he lit them with a wave of his hand, bowed deeply, and felt an unexpected closeness rise within him, unable to stop himself from murmuring inwardly,

_Since you were the Imperial Monarch of ancient Wei, a thousand generations have passed, and few like me remain to offer sacrifice. For the sake of this incense, I pray that you protect my family—that we may produce a Golden Core True Monarch. Even if Zhaojing faces calamity by water, fire, or lightning, I shall have no fear…_

But as he finished speaking, the light above seemed to freeze. A pang of guilt shot through Li Ximing’s heart. He straightened immediately, raising his brows in alarm.

The portrait above had changed. The emperor in white robes and golden armor no longer showed his face; only pale-golden light flickered faintly within the painting.

The emperor’s back now faced him, his figure shrinking gradually, receding deeper and deeper into the scroll.

“This painting is indeed full of spirituality!”

Li Ximing bowed again, and as he straightened, he stole a quick glance upward—only to see the Bright Yang Monarch diminished to a speck, like an Immortal fading into a vast snowstorm, before vanishing completely.

He rose dejectedly and turned toward Bright Yang Minister.

The 'High Radiance True Monarch' had turned his back as well, ceasing to face him.

Li Ximing took the hint, turned his head toward the first painting, and found that the “Bright Yang Immortal” remained unchanged—calm as still water, utterly unmoved.

“I’ve heard that within the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate… there is another one. I wonder if it’s this very piece.”

But imperceptibly, the light in the pavilion began to dim. Everything receded rapidly into darkness. Then, from afar, a faint voice echoed, tinged with laughter,

“Fellow Daoist Zhaojing! How was it?”

He blinked, dazed, and found himself once more before the pavilion. Lu An’s politely smiling face appeared, his gaze shifting uncertainly.

Li Ximing took a deep breath and sighed.  
“It is truly a profound pavilion—to even house a portrait of the Bright Yang Monarch!”

His words came from the heart, yet they left Lu An momentarily speechless. Longkang Yao had chosen Lu An for this task and invited Zunxian for support; they had already expected the pavilion to be empty. Should Li Ximing gain nothing, Zunxian could use his ties with the Ning-Li branch to smooth matters over.

But upon hearing 'Bright Yang Monarch,' this direct descendant of the Lu brothers froze, shaken inwardly.

*Li Ximing… It’s one thing for him to be closer than Li Jieyi, but how could the Bright Yang Monarch personally manifest for him!*

Back then, Li Jieyi of the Purple Terrace’s Profound Pavilion—a proper descendant of the Wei-Li line, unaffiliated with the Ning-Li branch—had visited this prefecture and only managed to catch sight of Bright Yang Minister!

*It must be the blessing of the White Qilin!*

After much thought, that seemed the only possible explanation. But regardless, it was a fortunate event. Lu An smiled and said politely,

“So there truly was a benefit… may I ask what kind?”

Li Ximing walked alongside him, mentioning it offhandedly. Zunxian, however, showed no surprise. Turning toward Changyun, whose expression he observed carefully, he smiled faintly and said,

“Since Daoist Master Changyun is here… would you care to enter the pavilion for a look?”

Li Ximing knew Changyun was up to something. He turned around, about to respond on the Daoist Master’s behalf, when Changyun himself looked up with an unhurried smile and said,

“I am but a humble rogue cultivator; there’s no need for me to make a fool of myself. After all, the Great Dao of the world has Three Profundities—how could there be no traces lingering behind? If I were truly to encounter some Ancestral Master, should I acknowledge the ancestors I already worship, or the one before me? It would be… awkward. Truly awkward.”

His words were sharp. Zunxian’s smile stiffened. He covertly cast a glance at Lu An, and the two exchanged looks—difficult to persuade, difficult to refute. In the end, they could only smile wryly and drop the matter for now.

His words were sharp. Zunxian's smile faltered, and he secretly glanced at Lu An. The two exchanged a look; it was difficult to persuade and difficult to respond. They could only nod with a smile and drop the matter for the time being.

Li Ximing paused for a moment, vaguely sensing a fluctuation of divine ability. In an instant, a youth appeared, moving from the distance to the front of the pavilion at great speed. He first bowed, his gaze calm, and said,

“Senior Zhaojing!”

The person appeared quite at ease, with large eyes and long eyebrows. Ghostly energy roiled around him, and his eyes were filled with helplessness. Li Ximing recognized him at once and cupped his fist, saying,

“Fellow Daoist Pang.”

Pang Yi!

In the recent calamity that shook Gu Prefecture, Pang Yi could be considered a meritorious official who had rightfully earned his place. Whether from the Bright Yang side or the Blazing Aridity Heaven side, the Pang clan had earned plenty of favors and should have been basking in glory.

Yet Pang Yi showed no sign of triumph, feeling instead a deep unease. During his days in the prefecture, he had been exceedingly cautious.

Back when he conspired with Li Jiangqian, Pang Yi had already mentioned that now that his Pang clan was staying in the prefecture, it was impossible for them to retreat with Bright Yang. They had offended the Fu clan, and Gu You did not look upon him favorably either. The only one he could rely on was Longkang Yao!

He was cautious in all things and had not intended to see Li Ximing, but he had no choice but to come at Longkang Yao’s behest. At this moment, he also appeared formal—something Li Ximing could naturally discern. He listened as Pang Yi said,

“The Great Daoist Master requests your presence.”

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal nod, not bothering to answer him.

Lu An, however, took note of this with a peculiar expression.

*I heard that Fu He sent someone to sow discord before the Li clan, and Pang Yi was tricked first… No wonder Li Ximing has been polite all this time, without a trace of arrogance, yet treats him so differently.*

Pang Yi accompanied them the entire way, but upon reaching the gates, he barred Changyun from proceeding. Li Ximing then followed Pang Yi inside, immediately feeling a wave of heat rush against his face.

The red-robed Daoist Master was standing in the courtyard, saying nothing.

Pang Yi spoke no further, merely leading him forward before turning to take his leave. Li Ximing waited a moment, then said softly,

“Greetings, Senior Longkang.”

Only after these words fell did the red-robed Daoist Master turn around, revealing a handsome face and eyes that seemed to burn with raging fire. His gaze swept over and came to rest on Li Ximing’s face.

“So, it is Daoist Master Zhaojing.”

This direct descendant of Blazing Aridity Heaven took a step forward and said faintly,

“Longkang Yao, Enforcer of Blazing Aridity Heaven, of the Blazing Aridity Daoist Tradition of the Purple Terrace, following the Lesser Yang Dao-path of Comprehending Profundity, from the lineage of the Blazing Aridity True Monarch.”

“Greetings to the Imperial Descendant of Bright Yang.”

At this moment, Longkang Yao finally shed his cold and emotionless demeanor of the past, speaking with solemnity, each word respectful. Hearing his words, Li Ximing simply lowered his head and said,

“I have long heard of Blazing Aridity’s fame.”

Subtly, Li Ximing’s attitude seemed to put Longkang Yao at ease. The expression on his face gradually softened. As he sat down with him, flames coalesced to the side, and a woman walked out from within. She was exceedingly beautiful, dressed in white and crimson robes. As she poured tea for the two, her hair ornaments swayed, and a delicate fragrance filled the air.

Li Ximing’s spiritual sense perceived that the woman was actually a manifested ghost-deity—a rare sight in this day and age. He couldn’t help but nod as he listened to Longkang Yao speak in a gentler tone,

“On behalf of Gu You… I thank King Wei.”

The Great Daoist Master raised his cup, his expression earnest and free of arrogance or awkwardness, showing only sincere gratitude. He drank it all in one gulp, stopping Li Ximing—who was feeling slightly uneasy—and said with a sigh,

“I have said before, this matter… was my mistake.”

He actually smiled and said faintly, “The affair with Bright Yang was originally none of my concern. Because of some personal favors, I made an abrupt trip, which ended up ruining King Wei’s grand plan. If Gu You had fallen, I would only have avenged him, not borne a grudge.”

“But since King Wei let him return, I cannot repay kindness with enmity.”

Longkang Yao’s expression was calm, as if he were discussing something that had nothing to do with him. Seeing that he was easy to talk to, Li Ximing remembered Li Zhouwei’s advice, *Just praise him to the high heavens!*

And so he struck while the iron was hot, his expression complex as he said,

“Great Daoist Master, you may not know! I am considered one of the old guard in my family. I have watched King Wei expand his territory from south to north, and no one has ever been his match in a single encounter. The likes of Qi Lanyan and Vast Cicada either relied on treasured lands or powerful artifacts, yet they all perished one by one!”

He sighed.

“Only the Great Daoist Master alone was able to block him in the east. Your divine abilities and Dao-Profundity are truly world-shaking, whereas the people around me…”

He feigned hesitation, touched his sleeve, and took out the Spiritual Treasure—*Heavenly Nurture Urn.*

“I came today… also for the life-mandate of another Daoist Master.”

Li Ximing stepped aside and stood with his hands clasped. Freed from suppression, the Spiritual Treasure instantly flashed with multicolored light. A cascade of azure brilliance surged forth, rapidly condensing to manifest a figure on the spot!

The man was ancient and decrepit, his robes somewhat disheveled. He stood there trembling with fear, his old eyes darting left and right as if terrified of being shattered in the next second.

Wen Daoping!

The old man had been trapped in that urn, his cries to heaven and earth unanswered. For a time, the Spiritual Treasure had been needed to suppress Gu You, and when he was finally let out, no one dared speak much with him before he was inexplicably stuffed back inside. Now, finally released, the first person he saw was Longkang Yao!

Seeing the Great Daoist Master, Wen Daoping was both shocked and overjoyed, nearly bursting into tears as he understood everything in an instant.

*So they managed to get Great Daoist Master Longkang involved! That’s right—he even dared to capture Gu You; how could such arrogance be allowed to remain unchecked!*

Glancing at the respectfully standing Li Ximing, how could Wen Daoping not grasp the situation? A cool, refreshing sensation rushed to his head, and the resentment that had festered in his heart for days was instantly released. He lowered his head and said hatefully,

“Great Daoist Master! Bright Yang is tyrannical and unrestrained… acting with utter lawlessness! I, Wen Daoping, am also the descendant of a True Monarch, yet he has subjected me to such humiliation! My Mount Jiao, where I preached the Dao, was wantonly plundered by him. Today, this cannot be let go!”

“I vow to report this to Vast Plateau!”

His beard trembled with extraordinary rage. But the Great Daoist Master before him did not even spare him a glance. He sat quietly, set down his cup, and uttered two ice-cold words:

“Shut up.”
