# Chapter 1326: Southern Upheavel

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

The Heavenly Light blazed as white flowers drifted through the air. A woman sat cross-legged, pinching a talisman, seemingly cultivating by circulating a divine ability. On a platform one step lower, a man sat before a pill furnace, silently refining elixirs.

After a short while, someone came forward to report, their face beaming with joy.

"Daoist Master... the Young Master has arrived on the lake!"

Li Quewan opened her eyes, a silver light flashing past her pupils. She slowly exhaled. The light from the talisman before her flickered uncertainly. With a flick of her finger, she sent the talisman away.

It had not been long since Li Ximing had departed. Li Quewan had been studying the golden book while coordinating with Cheng Qian to advance the Profound Foundation, taking what spare time she had to instruct Qiao Yue—he had been cultivating under Li Ximing's guidance these past few years. Although Li Quewan was not skilled in alchemy, she was more than qualified to guide his cultivation.

Being interrupted now, she was actually a little surprised.

"Young Master? Which younger brother is it?"

The person bowed again and said,

"It is Young Master Jiangchun!"

Joy instantly bloomed in Li Quewan, and she rose to her feet. Sure enough, she saw a figure stepping out from the mountains. He was dressed in a low-key and simple manner, wearing only a white robe. His cultivation had already reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He carried a sword on his back and looked refreshed and spirited.

It was Li Jiangchun!

Li Quewan had not seen him for quite some time and now wore a faint smile, though a thread of doubt was hidden in her heart. Waving a hand to dismiss Qiao Yue, she said,

"How rare... that Uncle Zhouluo was willing to let you come back!"

Li Jiangchun's face was filled with guilt, and hearing her words, he shook his head even more, only saying,

"Congratulations, elder sister. The family has sent many letters recently. I was in deep seclusion and did not have time to reply... I rushed to the lake the moment I came out..."

"Seclusion?"

Li Quewan's beautiful eyes swept over him, and she rose to her feet in understanding.

"You were cultivating a secret art?"

Li Jiangchun smiled.

"Indeed, Daoist Master!"

Li Jiangchun's cultivation was particularly unique. He not only possessed the Lesser Yin Profound Monarch's Water-Fire Record but was also a rarely seen sword immortal. Now at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, he should have started cultivating a secret art long ago.

However, Lesser Yin techniques were exceedingly rare. Although the Li family had paid much attention over the years, they had never managed to obtain a Purple Mansion Realm-level secret art. Li Ximing had originally intended to ask Nine Mounds, but unexpectedly, Li Jiangliang had mentioned it early on, having Yang Tianyou, who was also in the imperial capital, retrieve a copy.

This copy of the Lesser Yin secret art contained three techniques, which was already considered excellent. Li Jiangchun had sent a reply back to the lake, but with the recent period of instability, the matter had been postponed. Li Quewan immediately understood what kind of seclusion he had been in and nodded.

"Was it the copy your sister-in-law gave you?"

Li Jiangchun, however, smiled.

"Father has been running errands for me for many years. He said... the family entrusted me to his hands, fulfilling the bond between father and son, so it was only natural for him to handle these things. A few years ago, he was the one who found a way and took me into the palace to study the technique!"

Li Quewan raised an eyebrow.

"How was it?"

Li Jiangchun's expression was slightly odd.

"They brought out a technique called the Regulating Coldness and Maintaining Dryness Scripture, which also accomplishes All-Fragrance Sinks. It is said to be a treasured and powerful technique of the Yang family, exceedingly profound and of the fifth grade... but..."

He lowered his voice and sent a mental transmission,

'I have studied and researched it. Profound it may be, but its profundity lies only in minor details. Compared to my current technique, it lacked the true profundity of a commanding perspective. It was actually inferior to what I could figure out myself...'

Li Quewan nodded inwardly as Li Jiangchun continued

"Only its secret arts were more numerous and a fraction more profound than the copy fourth sister-in-law provided. There were five in total, all of them extremely formidable. I'm afraid it's the kind of treatment reserved for direct Golden Core descendants in a Grotto-Heaven!"

Li Quewan smiled.

"In that case, I see you've had quite the harvest?"

The young man grinned.

"I have already mastered three of them!"

"Three?"

Even though Li Quewan was prepared, she could not help but feel a jolt in her heart. She raised her brows, gazing at the young man before her.

"The methods of Lesser Yin are all contained within the Water-Fire Record. I have cultivated this art for many years, and these specially selected secret arts are all related to water and fire. How could my progress not be swift?'

Li Quewan, who cultivated the Shamanic arts, could tell that Li Jiangchun's foundation in this technique, which he had practiced since childhood, must be incredibly deep. She could not help but smile and nod, then shook her head.

"I thought I would have some time to maneuver, but I didn't expect you to cultivate so quickly. It seems we will have to hurry things along."

Li Jiangchun replied, "Five techniques are more than enough..."

Li Quewan shook her head noncommittally, but her expression suddenly changed as she sensed a divine ability in the Great Void outside. She nodded for Li Jiangchun to withdraw first, wondering,

'At this time... who could be looking for me?'

She pinched her fingers to perform a divination and saw the Blazing Fire burning intensely outside. She immediately stood up and told Qiao Yue to guide the divine ability in. Sure enough, she saw a middle-aged man with a rather handsome face, who bowed to her and said,

"Fellow Daoist Suyun!"

"So it is Daoist Master Fu Chi."

This person was actually Tantai Jin!

This Daoist Master should have been stationed at Liangchuan. For some unknown reason, he had returned south, traveling all the way to the great lake, and appeared to be in a great hurry. Li Quewan was quite curious and simply said,

"Daoist Master, you are.."

Tantai Jin's expression changed slightly. Without elaborating, he bowed deeply and said,

"I have come bearing orders and have much news to report to Daoist Master Suyun. I will start with the most important matter—fighting has broken out in the Southern Borderlands!"

Li Quewan was stunned for a moment, her heart suddenly in turmoil. She raised her brows and asked,

"Can Lufu?!"

Tantai Jin nodded, his voice slightly grave.

"Last night... that great Flood Dragon swept through the Piaoren Kingdom in the depths of the Southern Borderlands, and the entire nation was overthrown. It is said that a vast number of citizens and cultivators were taken back to the Demon Ridge, a procession stretching for a thousand miles, too far for the eye to see!"

"The Piaoren Kingdom?"

Li Quewan fell silent for a moment.

The Piaoren Kingdom was the largest Shaman Kingdom in the south of the mainland. Its population was dense in the mountains and forests, numbering well over a million. It was relatively prosperous. Even if the ruler of a region was tyrannical, the number of cultivators was still extremely high. In its most glorious days, it could even form its own faction. Now it had declined, but its ruler was still a cultivator with two divine abilities!

Tantai Jin was quite uneasy.

"The ruler of that kingdom perished on the spot, and a nearby loosely-governed state was destroyed along with it. Luo Zangmulu was visiting a friend and escaped with only his life. Hundreds of years of accumulation were destroyed in an instant, and he couldn't even save his few disciples..."

"Luo Zangmulu.." Li Quewan paused slightly. "That's the Daoist Luo who cultivates Gathering Wood."

"Precisely!"

This Daoist Luo was an acquaintance who had some dealings with Li Ximing in the past. When the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was in decline, he had come to lend his strength and had also received a share of the spoils...

Li Quewan's fine brows furrowed. "He saw that the north and south were fighting fiercely and concluded that the south could not spare the attention to deal with him, so he took advantage of the vacuum!"

Tantai Jin sighed, "Indeed. The entire court is now in shock, and everyone suspects he will make another move. I was urgently summoned back to the capital under the pretext of reporting on my duties... and was specifically told to pass by the lake to remind Suyun!"

Li Quewan understood his meaning.

'Although Qing Jifang is in seclusion, Western Shu still possesses a strength that cannot be underestimated. The Sun Clan and the Chen Clan have a blood feud spanning many years. Once trouble starts in the south, it is highly likely that the west will take advantage of the situation.'

"If fighting breaks out again, the people in the north will have to be withdrawn to provide aid."

She immediately sensed trouble, her brows knitting tightly. Tantai Jin sighed again.

"The troubles are far from few. Does Fairy Quewan still remember—the Wei and Jia families?"

"Naturally."

Li Quewan paused as she listened to him continue,

"The Wei Clan has a very remarkable junior named Wei Dangshan. He was said to be the foremost genius in Luoxia, possessing a Dao-comprehension unseen in the Wei Clan for centuries... Last night, a crimson light shot into the sky above the capital. It was the sign of his demise!"

As soon as these words were spoken, the first to change color was actually Qiao Yue, who had been standing silently to the side all along. The man's eyes were filled with disbelief, as if he had heard something utterly impossible. Li Quewan was first taken aback, then immediately came to an understanding and replied,

"The Great Tomb River..."

"Yes... Although King Wei is benevolent and specifically spared his life from the great war, who could have expected such a change at the Great Tomb River? The river changed its course, the lands between the Huai reappeared, and the Valley Water in the Great Void, like the tail of a comet, swept from the Great Tomb River all the way to the Central Plains, and then from the Central Plains towards the Eastern Sea..."

"It was thought that the lands of Jin would be the ones to suffer, but who knew that the heavens were so unpredictable. This change did not just cover one area but was like a long river. The lands of Jin, conversely, suffered little. As for the other places... how could a mere seeker of Purple Mansion Realm withstand it... His death was considered late, at that time... cultivators from other families perished on the spot..."

He sighed.

"For such a genius to fall so carelessly! Daoist Master Jia was with me at the time. When he saw the celestial phenomenon and heard the news, he coughed up blood on the spot. His face was pale, he was utterly crestfallen, and wouldn't respond no matter how we called him..."

Li Quewan said softly, "This is also a matter beyond anyone's control... King Wei may have the heart to cherish talent, but the grand tide of events is merciless. Where can this grievance be directed? He can only admit his bloody misfortune..."

Tantai Jin shook his head. "Misfortunes never come singly. A few days ago, a capable junior of Qinghu's perished during his breakthrough. His name was Sima Tongyi, and he fell very easily... Qinghu probably knows by now."

Li Quewan could only offer her condolences before changing the subject.

"In that case, I'm afraid the lake must also be on guard!"

Tantai Jin nodded silently, glanced at her, and said hesitantly,

"This is not an easy matter to handle. The Daoist Master must be extra vigilant. We cannot spare any manpower at the moment. I heard that Daoist Master Lin has been asked to return and will arrive at the lake soon. When I departed, the fighting in the north had also started. King Wei was not seen. Instead, it was Daoist Master Changli leading the defense of the city... There may be more changes......"

His time was short. After saying this, he already intended to leave, but was stopped by the woman. She bowed and said in a gentle, soft voice,

"The old senior lent me a Spiritual Treasure back then, which I have used for many years. Only now have I had the chance to return it. I am deeply ashamed and have long thought of properly thanking Nine Mounds..."

She opened her hand, and in her snow-white palm, a moon-like radiance appeared, its patterns intricate. This astonishingly valuable Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure was handed over so easily, yet she showed not the slightest trace of regret.

"Returning the item to its rightful owner..."

Tantai Jin was about to say more, but the woman before him took out a jade box, interrupting him.

"I hear that fellow Daoist cultivates Blazing Fire. King Wei has long taken notice. This is a small token of our appreciation; you must accept it!"

Tantai Jin said, "Since fate has brought us together, you and I share a bond like that of disciple-brothers. Why must you be so courteous?"

He refused twice but ultimately accepted the item. Li Quewan could see that his time was tight and simply nodded with a smile.

"My younger clan-brother cultivates Lesser Yin. In the future, we will have to trouble your noble Dao!"

Tantai Jin was taken aback at first, then shook his head with a laugh.

"Suyun must not know, right? King Wei has newly acquired a Daoist Master who is a high-level cultivator of the Lesser Yin Dao. He must have already considered this matter... No need to worry!"

And so he said no more and headed south.

Only then did Li Quewan understand. She watched him depart into the distance, a sense of unease growing in her heart. She closed her eyes, feigning deep thought, but in reality, she was connecting to the Spirit Probe, casting her gaze far out in all directions. Detecting no divine abilities, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.

But it would have been better not to look. With this one look, she discovered that an old man had long been standing on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, pacing hesitantly at its base. He seemed to have been waiting for a long time but could not make up his mind whether to come up. She took a closer look and saw that it was indeed Xiao Yuansi. She raised an eyebrow and sent a mental transmission, instructing,

"Please come up, old senior!"

A few days ago, Li Quewan had brought the news back. Li Ximing had immediately met with Xiao Yuansi and informed him. The old man had returned to his cave dwelling to weep. Although Li Ximing could not bear it, he had received his orders and had to leave for the north at once, so he did not have time to look after him much..

"He must have recovered somewhat."

Xiao Yuansi's status was beyond question. This old man was a disciple-brother of a sword immortal, had met several generations of ancestors, and had even refined pills for Li Tongya and Li Xiangping. Li Quewan did not dare to be neglectful in the slightest. After giving the order, she personally went down to receive him.

She saw an old man coming up the mountain, his hair completely white, exuding an aura of twilight decay. His head was hanging low, and he seemed somewhat slow. When he suddenly saw the divine ability descend, he hurriedly bowed down.

"Greetings.."

Li Quewan was extremely tense and helped him up.

"I wouldn't dare... I wouldn't dare! You honor me too much, senior!"

She dismissed the others and led the old man up to the mountain peak. After serving him tea, she asked with concern,

"My condolences, senior.."

Only then did Xiao Yuansi raise his head, tear stains still visible on his old face.

"I've made a fool of myself before the Daoist Master. This humble cultivator has come with a request..."

Li Quewan quickly replied, "Please speak, senior!"

The old man's lips trembled. "The Daoist Master has fallen, shaking heaven and earth, but at the Great Tomb River, various arts are intertwined and the Great Void trembles. Much of the news cannot be transmitted back to Cangzhou... And there is no one in charge in Cangzhou. I hope... I hope the Daoist Master will let me return!"

She would have been willing to grant any condition he named, even a Purple Mansion spiritual item, yet these words made her deliberate. She said in a soft and gentle voice,

"Please rest assured, old senior. Cangzhou is sparsely populated, and the Xiao Clan has acted with discretion for many years, with excellent family discipline. Nothing will happen in such a short time. On the contrary, with the turmoil on all four borders, I fear that a rash trip north might lead to you being intercepted, which would in turn implicate the Xiao family... That would not be good..."

"Grand-uncle also said long ago that once the north and south are a bit more stable, he will personally escort you back. This is only proper... The appearance of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator will also bring stability to the Xiao family."

She was thoughtful, and with her gentle and kind words of persuasion, Xiao Yuansi fell silent for a moment.

"The Daoist Master's considerations are thorough..."

He wept.

"But I recall, when the lake was first rising, it was Guilan who married into the Li Clan, and my Mount Yu branch married Qingxiao... When Zhaojing reached the Purple Mansion Realm, I even brought her here to offer congratulations... Now, the Mount Yu branch has been settled on the Northern Sea's Clan Maiden Island. Muyun has become the island's master, and Qingxiao lives in deep seclusion... she is rarely seen anymore.."

"This is a story told as a fine tale. Today, I was also thinking... of continuing it."

Li Quewan was taken aback. Looking at the old man before her, she noticed that Xiao Yuansi was extremely uneasy as he said in a low voice,

"This time... I ask for a direct descendant of the Immortal Clan... to marry over..."
