# Chapter 1330: The Thunder Chief

The golden platform gleamed, and the incense in the great hall flickered.

A milky aroma of incense drifted through the center of the hall, where a round table had been placed to the side, set with wine, meat, and a couple of vegetarian dishes. Minghui, holding jade chopsticks, sat opposite his disciple-brother Mingmeng. They drank and celebrated, creating a lively scene.

Between the two of them sat a green alms bowl, upon which a pair of chopsticks had also been placed, its accompanying wine cup filled to the very brim.

"This cup is to celebrate our Joyful Bliss Dao's graceful escape!"

Minghui laughed heartily and, along with his disciple-brother, raised a toast toward the wine vessel before the green bowl. Only then did he pour the full cup of wine into the bowl. He cocked his ear, listening to the gurgling sound of wine being drunk from within.

Amidst the tranquility, a bell thrummed. Golden light flowed like a waterfall over the eaves. An unknown amount of time passed before a tide of crimson surged forth, coming to a halt before the great hall.

The color coalesced into a head. Everything from the neck down was gone, the stump smooth and clean. Its expression was still somewhat rigid and filled with panic. It was none other than the eldest disciple-brother of the Joyful Bliss Dao—Mingzang!

But this ever-prideful eldest disciple-brother had not even had time to restore his body. Utterly bereft of dignity, he had fled back to the Lotus Temple in a frantic rush, crashing like a great stone from the heavens onto the brilliant golden floor with a thud.

The sound startled the two drinking monks inside, who leaped to their feet. Mingmeng wiped the wine from the corner of his mouth, greatly distressed. Minghui was even quicker; he rolled up his sleeves, hurried to pick up the head, and turned its pain-filled face toward his own, crying out in anguish,

"Eldest Disciple-brother!"

He saw that the face on Mingzang's lone head was contorted in a ferocious snarl, two lines of bloody tears streaming down.

"Disciple-brother... Master... he is... finished..."

The moment these words were spoken, the green bowl on the golden table atop the high platform leaped as if it had been struck. It looked as if it would topple over, sending the two chopsticks rolling to the ground with a clatter.

Mingzang closed his eyes and said with venom,

"It was the Way of Great Desire and the Compassion Dao! They came to contend not only for the Golden Land. Seeing that Great Virtue Kongshu's strength was astounding, holding his own against many without losing ground, they were immediately overcome by malice!"

"At that time... Master was injured by Kongshu. That Tian Langzhi and the Compassion Temple immediately joined forces. To protect us disciple-brothers... Master personally covered the retreat... A tragedy for his eight lifetimes of glorious reputation... to be schemed against in such a way..."

He was a great being among the Buddhist cultivators, his status in the Buddhist Land second only to his Master and the Liangli of the various Daos. Having vaguely sensed a Dharma Aspect making a move, he had already concluded the worst. When he burst into the hall and saw his disciple-brother showing no grief, only distress, he surmised that their Master had not yet returned and that the news had not yet arrived.

'Even I managed to escape, yet my disciple-brother shows no sign of grief. Could Master have been suppressed?'

He asked with trepidation, "Is there still no news from the Buddhist Land?"

Minghui simply raised his hand, signaling to his disciple-brother. Mingmeng understood at once, retrieved the green bowl from the golden table, and presented it to their eldest disciple-brother.

Mingzang froze, noticing that the green bowl was vibrating ceaselessly, emitting a faint, distorted sound. It was incredibly strange and no divine ability or wondrous art had any effect on it. He could only press his ear against it to hear a vigorous voice from within, cursing,

"Insolent disciple! To hell with my eight lifetimes of fame!"

"Ma... Master!"

Mingzang was stunned for a moment. He hastily tried to form his limbs as his hands trembled, quickly taking the green bowl from his disciple-brother's grasp. Hearing another mumble from within, the voice inside sneered,

"Your Master's calculations are supreme, you couldn't unravel them in ten lifetimes. And yet you dare to speak of eight lifetimes of fame?"

Only then did realization dawn on Mingzang. He clutched the green bowl as tears streamed down like rain. He also resented his master for not breathing a word of his plan, playing the entire Joyful Bliss Dao for fools along with everyone else. He said aloud,

"In the end, it is Master... Truly, your cunning is unmatched!"

"Cunning you..."

He anticipated another curse from within and immediately handed the green bowl back to his disciple-brother, letting it vibrate unceasingly. Once he had calmed his emotions, Minghui quickly stepped forward to help him up, led him to the table, poured wine to toast him, and said with a smile,

"Disciple-brother, you may not know, but with Master's full protection, our two other disciple-brothers returned long ago. Martial Uncle Jinshan suffered a more wretched fate, but his True Spirit made it back. Now that you have also returned, Eldest Disciple-brother, our sect is finally whole again!"

Mingzang still had his doubts. The Dao lineage he cultivated was the Way of Absolute Bliss Samadhi, and within it, he sought to attain the Samadhi of Emptiness, a path far stricter than that of his disciple-brothers. He accepted the wine, touched it lightly to his lips in a token gesture of drinking, and said,

"I just wonder what spell arts the old man has hidden away, that he has yet to teach us, to be able to escape from such a hopeless predicament."

Mingmeng placed the green bowl back in the seat of honor and poured a cup of clear wine for their master before smiling.

"Disciple-brother, you are mistaken. He received help from a benefactor!"

He then recounted the events in the Golden Land one by one, causing Mingzang to shift restlessly in his seat, his expression changing drastically several times. After a long while, he finally let out a long sigh and said with delight,

"So that is how it was! Master has stumbled upon a great opportunity!"

The green bowl ceased its shaking and stood perfectly still at the head of the table. Mingzang glanced at it, almost able to picture his master's proud, chest-puffed posture. He shook his head and laughed, not holding back his praise as he said,

"To be able to evade the calamity of the present world, Master's move was truly sublime!"

The atmosphere in the hall instantly grew warmer. Mingmeng went to the offerings on the altar, stripped the pious men and women of their flesh and skin, and guided them one by one through the white-bone contemplation, filling the table with sounds of gratitude.

Mingzang, however, swept his gaze over them and shook his head.

"Disciple-brother, you have cultivated this path of Terror Dispelling for a hundred years. Why are you still fixated on such a superficial level of flesh and skin? You continue to dispel terror for these minor cultivators, but it is the cultivation of these little Master Monks that grows. What about your own? Though you commit no error, you gain little merit."

Jinlian was an unreliable sort. The Great Dao of the Joyful Bliss Dao was passed down by Mingzang, who had adopted some of his master's mannerisms. The moment he spoke, both of his disciple-brothers lowered their heads. But Mingzang did not let Minghui off, saying sternly,

"And you... relying on Master's favor, you declared you would study Compassion to establish a Buddhist Land. Then you went and got yourself injured and decided to switch to the path of pursuing good. After so many years without a proper direction, it is only right that your progress has stagnated!"

Minghui had a grievance he could not voice—he had received those injuries on the lake, and during the escape back to the Lotus Temple, even his own master had suffered greatly. How could he speak of it? He quickly averted his gaze, lifted the green bowl, and held it before his two disciple-brothers, pleading,

"Master..."

"Ahem."

Jinlian's wondrous fluctuation, though faint, carried a rare note of solemnity. He said,

"What your disciple-brother said is not without reason. The Dao paths of you two are unclear, and you must be more prudent. I cannot always be by your side in the future, so you must be even more cautious... As for Mingzang..."

He continued, "I have now paved your path for you."

Mingzang started, lifting his head to hear his master laugh and say,

"Do you remember... the Emptiness Liangli... Zhelu?"

"Naturally, I remember..."

Jinlian sneered.

"I was severely wounded today by the Way of Great Desire and the Compassion Dao, but it allowed me to see things clearly. That old peacock from the Way of Great Desire is likely a very capable one. In the future of the eastern Buddhist Lands, a conflict between Great Desire and Compassion is inevitable... Once that conflict begins, Zhelu will certainly be killed by King Wei!"

His voice grew lower.

"Emptiness and Joyful Bliss originally stemmed from a single branch. When I taught you the Samadhi of Emptiness back then, I entertained the covetous idea of a unified path, but it was suppressed and cut off by Mount Dayang and the Way of Great Desire..."

"From the look of things now... it may not be so impossible!"

Mingzang's expression changed dramatically.

"A unified, coveted path!"

"Correct!"

Jinlian laughed heartily, his tone suggesting a completely different line of thought. He said,

"The Compassion Dao appears inactive, but ever since the Imperial Edict of Central Xuan, Immortals have entered the demonic path, and demons have entered the Buddhist path. A terrifying power certainly lies hidden within the Buddhist Lands. As long as Zhelu falls and the Way of Great Desire clashes with Compassion, the Way of Great Desire will not have a free hand!"

"And do not forget, the Emptiness Dao's Great Emptiness Dao-Seeking Plate... in whose hands does it rest now?! We never would have dared to imagine it before, but now, it might be possible!"

Mingzang was momentarily shaken.

'Master means for me to find a way to take control of the Emptiness Dao!'

Who would not want to become a Liangli?

Mingzang remained silent, but Minghui stroked his chin, nodding to himself.

'Making such a grand promise to Eldest Disciple-brother... It seems that soon enough, he'll still have to drag his ailing body out to manage the temple's affairs and negotiate with Mount Dayang...'

But before another word could be said, the bells outside began to ring violently. A faint golden light streamed down, smashing head-on toward the temple as a majestic and ferocious voice boomed:

"Where are the people of the Joyful Bliss Dao!"

"Hurry and crawl out here to admit your guilt!"

Vague peals of thunder erupted. Someone attempted to force their way in but was blocked by the radiance of the Joyful Bliss Buddhist Land. The three of them exchanged a glance:

Mount Dayang!

Minghui had long anticipated this moment and was not the least bit panicked. He waved his hand, signaling his disciple-brothers to retreat into the Buddhist Land. Mingzang hesitated for a moment, but Jinlian trusted this disciple and only said,

"The Discipline Dao strikes without a trace, so Mount Dayang cannot be certain of my condition. No matter what you say, insist that I have perished. In this matter, our position will be justified no matter what!"

After those brief words, he immediately withdrew.

Minghui remained, taking a seat in a high position to the side and calling out,

"Come in!"

His voice echoed for a moment, followed by a distinct pause from outside. Then, the radiance of the Buddhist Land receded with a great sound, and a vajra-visaged monk stormed in step by step. His face was adorned with purple-gold patterns, and with a single step, he shattered the ground beneath his foot, sneering,

"Instead of crawling out to kneel, you dare to sit up there so smugly!"

Clearly, the newcomer was even more furious.

His voice was like converging violet lightning, exploding within the great hall. Minghui felt a wave of killing intent wash over him, and his heart leaped violently.

'Maodigu... the Thunder Chief!'

Mount Dayang had established the position of Chiefs, and Maodigu was one of the foremost among them. With a profound background, he was renowned for his violent temperament and iron-faced impartiality. He had been in seclusion for many years. For him to be summoned south now was a clear sign of Mount Dayang's rage!

'Some failure is taking their frustrations out on me!'

But even as cold sweat broke out on his brow, the monk before him moved like a bolt of violet lightning, appearing before him in an instant. He locked his hand around Minghui's throat and, right there in the Buddhist Land of the Lotus Temple, lifted him up and slammed him viciously to the ground!

"BOOM!"

The golden floor instantly spiderwebbed with cracks. A dense surge of violet lightning blasted into his face, causing him to spit a mouthful of golden blood. His already unhealed injuries grew even more severe.

Minghui, however, remained utterly fearless, sneering,

"King Wei... he went to Xuan Chao, did he not? Which high-level cultivator did he kill to make the Chief so enraged?"

Seeing him so unyielding, Maodigu actually paused for a moment. Thunder crackled across his unmoving, angry vajra-face as he glared.

"He has already breached Mount Jiao... Even Wen Daoping... was injured and captured by him... All thanks to the great contribution of the Joyful Bliss Dao..."

His tone dripped with both sarcasm and anger, yet he saw not a shred of fear in Minghui, who laughed loudly.

"He deserved it! That old bastard thought he had some skill, winning people over by healing a few minor injuries. He never had a pleasant look on his face..."

Maodigu heard no explanation. The flames of rage in his heart surged. He released his grip, raised his foot, and with a thunderous crash, crushed Minghui's golden arm, stating flatly,

"You have harmed the public for private gain and indulged a Buddhist enemy. I will not waste my breath on you. Have Jinlian come out to see me."

"Harmed the public for private gain, indulged a Buddhist enemy... Good, good, good..."

Hearing this, Minghui immediately lifted his head, his eyes welling with tears.

"I harmed the public for private gain and indulged a Buddhist enemy, fine! That was just a struggle for the Golden Land. But what do you call it when Great Desire and Compassion murdered my Master!"

Maodigu was profoundly shocked. He froze, staring at the monk before him, who continued resolutely,

"You ask for my Master? What, after our fellow cultivators have killed my Master, you now come to my Buddhist Land to look for him? What is it this time? Are you going to claim my Master died from his own cultivation?"

Flames congealed in Maodigu's pupils, and the icy coldness on his face was swiftly replaced by shock. He stared blankly at the monk on the floor and said,

"Jinlian has fallen?"

"How is that possible! No bells tolled on the mountain!"

"How is that possible?"

Minghui's eyes were crimson, glaring as if they would split at the seams, his lips trembling as he spoke.

"Chief, since you have come to condemn me, why waste more words? Yes, my Lotus Temple did not stop Li Zhouwei. Go on, capture me and take me back, and let Great Desire and Compassion kill me as well!"

These words carried a genuine weight of emotion—though Jinlian had faked his death, Minghui had been genuinely terrified at first. It was impossible to say he felt no hatred. In that moment, every word was spoken as if crying blood, his heart filled with loathing.

Upon hearing this, Maodigu's hand loosened instinctively. Hesitation and regret flickered across his angry vajra-face, and his voice softened as he said in a low tone,

"Jinlian and I are both of the eighth lifetime. If he were to perish overnight, how could my Mount Dayang not know!"

Minghui sneered.

"Master's True Spirit is long gone from our Buddhist Land!"

"The two Daos fought and brought harm to my Master, while King Wei watches like a tiger. If my Joyful Bliss Dao does not lock down the news and stabilize our Buddhist Land, are we to wait for him to find out and attack our very temple?"

Maodigu was struck speechless. He suddenly found it hard to stand his ground and could not meet Minghui's gaze, turning his head away. But Minghui pressed his advantage, saying with hatred,

"Just because our Dharma Aspect has not shown himself for many years, you Chiefs are bullying my tradition far too much... On one hand, you besiege and kill my Master at the Great Tomb River. On the other, you demand that we disciple-brothers go out to intercept King Wei... It seems that until every last member of my Lotus Temple is annihilated, Mount Dayang will not rest!"

He cried out,

"But let me ask you, Chief! In the west, you surrounded my Master, eager to eliminate him. In the east, the situation is dire, and you want my disciple-brothers to be fed to the qilin. This... if it were you, Chief, I imagine you would have already charged up the mountain in a rage."

Maodigu could no longer maintain his composure. There was a degree of sincerity in the monk's heart, and he understood that the man before him would not dare lie. He sighed to himself.

'I do not know how much of what he says is true, but there must be a reason why the Lotus Temple was unwilling to give its all... But for an eighth-lifetime cultivator like Jinlian to be murdered, that is something they surely cannot swallow. Even if the Joyful Bliss Dao committed a thousand wrongs, what wrong could be greater than the life-mandate of an eighth-lifetime Maha! They went too far!'

Thus, he shamefully released his grip, helped Minghui to his feet, and said:

"It was I who was reckless... Everyone in Lotus Temple has suffered greatly... As a Chief, I will surely see justice done!"
