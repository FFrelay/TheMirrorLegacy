# Chapter 1303: All Waters

'Chi Buzi...'

This name was like a clap of thunder splitting the heavens; the distant Daoist Master raised his head, staring fixedly at this location from afar, the True Fire in his eyes burning fiercely.

He was not surprised, yet his emotions were somewhat complex.

Chi Buzi had been missing for far, far too long.

During the time he was gone, the Simin Chi Clan that should have been entrusted to his hands had wavered and collapsed, smashing to the ground; the Azure Pond Sect was gradually hollowed out, leaving only an empty shell and a name, ultimately possessing nothing.

And now, this prized scion of the Chi family stood before the masses once more, the glow of Pristine Water on his body incomparably dense, as if the sundered past and the hollowed-out demonic sect had all become his tonic, nourishing him to radiant brilliance.

Tianque knew he would come, and knew that given his stance and his mind, he would certainly help Xiao Chuting; Tianque admired his methods but could not condone his actions, so upon truly seeing him, complexity inevitably filled Tianque's eyes.

Yet the boundless sword light did not pause for the voice; a world-overturning sword of Valley Water descended from the heavens.

This one sword, born from the proud, youthful hand of Murong Weidian and several centuries of arduous cultivation, was already falling!

Facing this sword, Chi Buzi's eyes remained icy and clear; he stood silently in the sky, raising his head, showing not a hint of fear or disquiet, only an unceasing smile.

"Senior Murong, we meet again."

_RUMBLE!_

A world-shaking explosion of gray water erupted; the fierce sword qi plowed across the water's surface, parting the endlessly rising Pit Water, and the heavy barrier of light within it looked like a single, drifting leaf.

An unnamable color filled Chi Buzi's narrow eyes as the blood-red talisman held between two fingers slowly dissipated.

Cave Spring's Echo.

Layer upon layer of black clouds surged in from both banks; all the sword qi that approached him began to boil, its shuddering, erupting grayness transforming into a rising azure, as if a great dam had burst, while the water's surface beneath his feet instantly turned viscous.

Heavy Murk!

Murong Weidian was truly worthy of being the Protector Daoist Master of the Yan Kingdom. Against his full-powered strike, Chi Buzi pushed two divine abilities to their extreme, and coordinating with Xiao Chuting, they finally found a small opening in the judgment-like gray qi.

The piercing energy vented, slicing countless gashes into the water's surface.

The azure-robed Daoist Master brushed the dim gray light from his robes, his expression rather surprised.

"Senior's divine ability has advanced yet again... This is truly divine ability perfection."

The expression on Murong Weidian's youthful face was indifferent. The sword that spanned the heavens was still in his grip, yet it was affected by the drifting Pristine Water, its tip trembling almost imperceptibly.

"So, it was you, such an ungrateful, cold, and heartless wretch."

"Hahahahaha!"

The young man burst into laughter as if he had heard something hilarious, his azure robes fluttering as layers of azure water rose behind him. Chi Buzi, as ever, felt not the slightest shame at these words, but instead smiled,

"Senior, you are mistaken; you are the one who drew your sword on an old friend, while I am the one who urges others toward seeking the Dao and forging great immortal virtue. This Chi may be uncaring toward the mortal world, but Senior is untrue to his own heart—you are worse than I!"

His voice resounded through the world, causing the water on the ground to boil and transform into crystal-clear droplets that shot upward, crawling along the pitch-black cage.

Murong Weidian gazed at him and said softly,

"I have always known you possess a sharp tongue; but regarding your mortal world and my own heart, my ambition lies not in supreme immortality, but in serving my kingdom. In this, there is no self, which is the definition of both righteousness and benevolence."

These words detonated across the world, and the youthful Murong Weidian, like a comet of heavenly judgment, shot through the intersection of roiling clouds and endless mist, his longsword aimed straight for Xiao Chuting!

Hearing this, the smile on Chi Buzi's face finally faded; his expression turned grim as he took a sideways step, raising one hand while the other slipped into his sleeve, and an endless, multi-layered torrent of azure water descended to conceal his figure:

Chou-Gui Hidden Form!

In that instant, the sword lost its target. Murong Weidian's exceptionally handsome face remained placid, two strands of hair drifting as the spot between his brows flashed, and the longsword continued onward.

Probing the Profound Recess.

This divine ability shone brilliantly, resonating with all the concealed dharma power, and combining with the descending longsword, it erupted with a boundless radiance that swept away the layers of protective Pristine Water!

Chou-Gui Hidden Form was certainly one of the world's most superb divine abilities, but the water it used for concealment was Valley Water. As one who had reached perfection in Valley Water divine abilities, even someone like Chi Buzi could not possibly hide from him!

Yet beneath the Pristine Water, there was no sign of Chi Buzi; only a string of ink-black beads hovered in the air, emitting a dense azure glow as they coiled around the edgeless heavy sword like an inky Flood Dragon, binding it fast.

Murong Weidian was not surprised.

Since Chi Buzi knew he had achieved perfection, how could he make such an error?

Murong Weidian raised his hand like a lightning bolt, blocking a descending treasured cauldron with two jade-white fingers while simultaneously receiving a sky full of Pristine Water from the east; his body sank abruptly, and he finally saw the young man's face.

Chi Buzi wore a smile, his voice extremely low.

"Be careful, Senior."

Murong Weidian felt a profound sense of danger well up in his heart and snapped his head around, just in time to see an azure shadow sweeping toward him, so fast it left only a flickering afterimage in his vision.

Xiao Chuting!

Murong Weidian's expression was peculiar; he offered no resistance, allowing the azure shadow to shatter his head into a spray of Valley Water, while his other hand pressed down on the inky beads on his sword.

The Ink Pond, a treasure Chi Buzi had refined for many years, vanished with that simple wipe.

But a smile emerged on the young man's face, brilliant and cold, reflecting in the eyes of the sword-wielding youth. As they locked gazes, a transparent, thread-like object finally appeared between their brows.

A line.

A small, emerald-green hook dangled from the end of the line, streaking across the sky as if pulling something immensely heavy, splitting the entire landscape in two; mountains pressed down and rivers coiled—it was Position Follows Peril!

'So that's how it is.'

A trace of astonishment flashed through the youthful Murong Weidian's eyes.

Chi Buzi's Chou-Gui Hidden Form was merely a feint; what it truly concealed was Xiao Chuting's jade hook!

'But... why did I not sense it?'

His divine ability was at perfection; it should have been impossible for Chou-Gui Hidden Form to deceive him.

Even with the Ink Pond as a distraction, as long as the divine ability was used for concealment rather than self-defense, he should have detected it instantly!

A gloomy light flashed in his eyes as he glanced at the new, small cauldron at Xiao Chuting's waist, seemingly lost in thought, but everything had already been turned upside down.

In that instant, the elder Murong Weidian, who had been observing the situation from afar, passed through countless obstacles and materialized, forcibly contracted into the same spot as the youthful Murong Weidian by the potent divine ability!

Valley Water possessed both inner and outer transformations; Murong Weidian, wary of their divine abilities, had sent only his youthful body forward while his elder self observed from a distance, but this formation was now shattered, forcing them to overlap in one position and instantly fall into peril—this was Position Follows Peril.

The old man opened his eyes for the first time, his gaze remote, yet there was no tyrannical divine ability crashing down, nor any follow-up secret arts. He saw that the young man before him had already raised his hand with perfect timing, pinching a tiny object in his jade-white fingers.

A pale-gold square seal, two fingers wide.

'Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal!'

Instantly, a pale azure radiance rippled out with unrivaled dominance, binding both of Murong Weidian's bodies, while the azure-robed Daoist Master opened his arms to embrace the descending light, laughing as he said,

"Please enlighten me, Senior!"

A dense azure light submerged everything.

The rustling of wind was barely audible as the azure fishing rod was lifted and rested on his shoulder; the heavy clouds and celestial phenomena all vanished, and the old man stepped forward.

The pitch-black prison shook violently as streams of gray light flowed out, illuminating the world. The radiances of various divine abilities continued to collide, yet the water level surged ever higher, reaching for the sky!

As if in response to Xiao Chuting's steps, a cryptic blue light finally rose from within the ring-shaped Judgement Prison, spreading upward along the central circle like a ladder reaching straight to the heavens.

As this thread-like blue light mingled with the sky, the entire world began to tremble; more and more light shone from the prison, converging in the sky above, forming a reflection that revealed a boundless ocean.

It was a pale blue, star-like expanse of water, twinkling with pinpricks of white light, standing silent and seemingly eternal in the sky.

Beneath this surface, countless swimming dragons seemed to writhe, occasionally revealing a ferocious scale or claw; at times it was a saber, at others a gourd, or a jade bowl.

These objects shimmered, clearly of extraordinary quality, but as they streamed past, a tiny, five-colored object finally broke the surface.

The object was no larger than a fingernail, resembling glazed glass and glowing brilliantly, capturing the attention of all Buddhist cultivators. The trembling golden bodies on the horizon froze, and the black-robed monk snapped his head up, his eyes flying open, his face, once as placid as still water, finally showing a trace of agitation.

'Great Virtue Sarira!'

Kongshu's gaze was instantly locked upon it.

He was naturally perceptive and had not deceived Xiao Chuting. This Sarira was undoubtedly the relic of the great Guanhe, and it was related to the Dharma Pool Golden Land the Seven Aspects were fiercely contesting!

But this was not the end; the moment the Sarira emerged, a pinpoint of light appeared, reflected in the illusory water's surface.

This light converged and then radiated outward, like a soft beam passing through an aperture, revealing within it the flow of a hundred rivers, overlapping gorges, and a myriad of landscapes, all possessing an indescribable nobility that made it impossible to look away.

Even the Sarira, a supreme treasure capable of allowing any Buddhist cultivator to establish their own sect free from outside control, seemed like a mundane object beneath this radiance, relegated to a lower status.

That trembling, soul-stirring, and profoundly evocative light was like a sharp sword piercing the pupils of every Daoist Master below, causing all of them to look up, frozen for a moment.

'Metallic Essence...'

'Pit Water Metallic Essence!'

'So that's how it is!'

For a moment, the divine abilities in the sky froze; colliding Spiritual Artifacts flew about aimlessly, their wielders distracted.

From Han Ling of the Yuanxia Immortal Clan above, down to the few Daoist Masters observing from afar, regardless of their Daoist Tradition or the divine abilities they were employing, even the Buddhist cultivators who had been fixated on the Sarira lost their focus and shifted their gaze, staring with ravenous hunger.

Countless gazes lingered covetously on that light, unwilling to look away; some were struck by sudden realization, others by boundless envy, some flashed with killing intent, and others hesitated, but not one person could tear their eyes away.

In that moment, it was as if every divine ability in the Great Tomb River had become Xiao Chuting's mortal enemy!

Only one person was an exception.

Kongshu.

The fair-skinned monk merely swept a respectful glance over the Metallic Essence, his gaze remaining firmly fixed on the Sarira. His many long-held doubts were instantly resolved, and tears welled in his eyes.

'So that's how it is...'

'Back then, the great Guanhe entered the Grotto-Heaven alone precisely to comprehend this Metallic Essence... He locked himself in this deep water prison, all for just one more glance at it!'

Now, that ancient Buddhist cultivator had been dead for countless years, leaving only this Sarira to circle that point of light, like a moth to a flame, now near, now far, unwilling to part even in death!

This beautiful scene brought the great battle to a pause, plunging the field into a boundless silence.

But that wisp of light moved.

As if sensing the aura of the numerous divine abilities, this Pit Water Metallic Essence rotated slightly; in that instant, drawn by an irresistible, wondrous allure, a cryptic blue beam shot down from the water's surface in the sky.

The beam flickered like light passing through water, resembling an azure sword only three fingers wide, yet it fell precisely toward Xiao Chuting. It contracted ten metres before him, twisting like a vortex until it became a single cryptic blue thread, seeking to shine from his brow into his Shengyang Acupoint.

'DONG!'

But in that instant, as if a distant bell tolled, the light suddenly froze.

The cryptic blue light suddenly split, a one-finger-wide beam shooting across the sky, aimed directly at the Great Daoist Master who stood controlling the True Fire!

The intangible space behind him, filled with raging True Fire, suddenly illuminated, revealing a youth in blue robes. His bearing was proud and his eyes remote, fixed intently on the distant Metallic Essence.

Su Yan!

His lips were pressed tightly together, showing not a hint of pride as he met those ancient, piercing eyes, an obscure emotion swirling in his own.

But Xiao Chuting did not step forward; he retracted his gaze, standing silently upon the cryptic blue radiance.

Someone new had appeared before the old man.

This man was tall and slender, with a gaunt, wrinkled face, and his Daoist robe and cloth shoes were exceedingly plain. Yet he had appeared at this very moment, silently shielding Xiao Chuting.

Xiao Chuting patted his straw rain-cape and said softly,

"I do not know which fellow Daoist this might be?"

The robed man looked at him with a smile, his gaunt face filled with admiration, and his eyes seemed to marvel.

"The Comprehending Profundity Great Dao, Lesser Yang Dao-path, Purple Terrace Zhiyang Daoist Tradition."

"Dry Yang Abbey."

He clasped his hands behind his back, as if sweeping away all other sounds in the universe, leaving only his own level voice.

"Qu Wo."
