# Chapter 1355: The Register

Wind and smoke churned.

The radiance of Dry Qi wove through the distance, bearing hues of flame as it rose and fell amidst the gloom of the twilight. Atop the majestic city, a cultivator clad in full armor stood with hands clasped behind his back, gazing out into the distance.

"The Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation..."

He murmured for a moment before the man to his side, his body wreathed in interwoven lightning and fire, spoke softly with a tranquil gaze,

"This is no easy territory to conquer."

The cultivator immediately turned, raising an eyebrow at him as he smiled.

"Daoist Master Shangguan, your background is profound... might you have a method in mind?"

This Daoist Master, flickering with lightning and fire, was none other than Shangguan Mi!

"Daoist Master Qiu, you speak too highly of me", Shangguan Mi said softly. "I may be of the Shangguan Clan, and my ancestors were one of the Six Surnames of Guanlong, but we came to the lands of Shu as refugees and have been in decline for a thousand years. How could my background be called profound?"

Daoist Master Qiu shook his head and said, "Fellow Daoist Shangguan, do not take me for an ignorant man. The renowned surnames of the world all trace back to the same few ancestors. The Wang Clan of Jiankan Yishui denied it vehemently back then, but if you truly dig into it, their ancestors were also a branch of the Wang Clan from Gu Prefecture. It is only because the main line of the Wang Clan is no longer prominent that they dare not accept the karma."

"What's more..."

He sized him up and down before sighing.

"Fellow Daoist, you have advanced yet again, achieving three divine abilities at such a young age. Such talent is surely extraordinary. To have been qualified as one of the Six Surnames back then, and to dare bear the Shangguan name so openly, you must have some connection to those Shangguan brothers of Tongxuan Palace, be it distant or close. Otherwise, you would have changed your name long ago..."

He shook his head in self-deprecation and said, "How could people like us ever compare!"

Shangguan Mi was rather astonished by his knowledge and could not help but study him for a moment longer before speaking,

"Fellow Daoist, you are truly a man of great insight!"

Daoist Master Qiu laughed, "Don't laugh, fellow Daoist, but I too ventured through the north in my youth!"

Shangguan Mi then nodded and said, "There are some rumors… that our Guanlong Shangguan did indeed have an ancestor who cultivated in Tongxuan Palace, and that otherwise we never would have come to the lands of Shu."

Though he said this, Shangguan Mi’s expression was unavoidably complex.

In the beginning, his lineage had little to do with Comprehending Profundity, yet they were deeply involved with Bright Yang. Later, they moved to the lands of Shu and indirectly fell under the Azure Profundity. To be blunt, they bore the marks of all Three Profundities.

‘The problem is that while we bear the marks of all Three Profundities, there isn’t a single one we can rely on. When they feel like giving face, they call you a descendant of Shangguan, but when they don’t, who takes me seriously?’

He fell silent, and after setting a time for battle, he took his leave.

Daoist Master Qiu proceeded all the way into the formation before he heard the young man who had been following him speak.

"Indeed... this is a fine formation. It has held for quite a few days."

Daoist Master Qiu looked up, a trace of doubt in his eyes as he gazed into the distance, and said,

"His Majesty’s side... what was their reply?"

The young man replied,

"His Majesty only bade this junior to convey a single message—"

"Feel free to attack."

Hearing this, the divine ability user before him was finally stirred. He turned back, no longer gazing at the distant gold, but strode into the formation. Step by step, he walked into the prefecture city, sat down in the small pavilion within the formation, and spoke in a low, somber tone.

"How confident are you?"

Only then did the young man raise his head, revealing a rather heroic face. His eyes were filled with resolve as he said,

"Ninety percent... Since the battle of the two passes has ended, factoring in the time for news to travel, we only need to wait another six days. Once six days pass, Jiang Yan will emerge from his seclusion, the north will be locked in a stalemate, and King Wei will be unable to extricate himself."

The Daoist Master frowned and said,

"Just wait idly like this?"

"Yes," the young man replied. "Not a moment sooner. We must wait until trouble erupts in the north. If Li Zhouwei is not caught in a great battle, he will never grant us sufficient time!"

The Daoist Master before him hesitated for a moment before speaking.

"Since you invited the Great Daoist Master over in advance, you must have made your preparations—but..."

He lifted his head, his expression complex, and said,

"By acting this way, we will surely become His Majesty's people. In the court today, who does not fear the Great General? We are fine for now, of course, but if he succeeds in his breakthrough, I fear he will make things difficult for us."

The young man showed no concern, merely smiling as he shook his head.

"My lord! How many times has our Qiu Clan risen and fallen over the years?"

The Daoist Master replied, "It has been a thousand years since we migrated from Guanlong..."

The young man sighed. "Although it is rumored that an ancestor of our Qiu Clan once cultivated beneath the Weak Water, you also understand, Daoist Master, that was far too long ago. The Nine Surnames of Wu—that’s all empty talk. The blood descendants of the Three Profundities Dao are mostly in the north, each name more renowned than the last. Pull any one of them out, and their ancestor is some True Monarch or Immortal. Looking at us is like looking at the common dust of the mortal world."

He continued quietly,

"Even among the people here in the lands of Shu—be it the Shangguan or the Li—they all hail from distinguished lines. And the Sun Clan, of the same origin, now basks in Song Yunbai’s good fortune and has even obtained a Great Daoist Master. It is only because the emperor is in peril that such a task would fall to us."

"I understand you do not wish to offend anyone lightly, Daoist Master, but some opportunities cannot be won even if one dares offense. This is a matter of heavenly timing, earthly advantage, and human harmony. Look at the Tanshan Li Clan—how desperately they sought to offend Bright Yang! And what was the result? Forsaken and forgotten. A long road of suffering lies ahead for them."

A flicker of gloom crossed the young man’s eyes as he went on,

"If we do not seize this chance to serve before the throne now, then when the time comes to be sent out to die, it will be people like us. Even you, Daoist Master, will not be able to protect yourself—let alone Qiu E."

The Daoist Master was momentarily speechless. Then, after a pause, he slowly nodded, a resolute light flashing in his eyes as he said,

"In that case, what are your arrangements?"

Qiu E replied, "We absolutely must invite Great Daoist Master Sun!"

With a grave expression, he continued, "Without him, we cannot handle this matter. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is already a tiger without its fangs, and Lin Chensheng is no great concern—but the Guyan Great Desert is not something we can endure!"

‘What’s more...’

A dark thought surfaced in Qiu E’s mind.

‘Without him... who will take the blow from the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance?’

He knew in his heart that the Ministerial Fire-Seeking Evil Spirit Formation was by no means as simple as it appeared. The one who had laid it in ages past was also a Heavenly Element, and their methods were utterly insidious.

In his previous life, that Great Daoist Master Sun had arrived too late. It had been his own Daoist Master who broke the grand formation, only for a bolt of Trinary Yang Annual Radiance to flood his heart and lungs amidst the formation’s thunderous collapse. It cost him decades of cultivation, and he ultimately perished tragically at the hands of Bright Yang.

‘This time, I did not hesitate to reveal my connections before the emperor, all to secure control over this Great Desert. I will claim this merit—and this grudge... Great Daoist Master Sun must be the one to bear it for us!’

He was lost in thought when Daoist Master Qiu’s voice sounded again.

"He hates the Chen Clan to the bone, wishing for nothing more than their extermination. How can the two of us possibly persuade him?"

Qiu E simply raised his hand, revealing the imperial secret decree held between his palms, and said in a low voice,

"Of course, we won’t be the ones to do it."

...

In the wind, a cold, mournful rain scattered across the land. The mountains seemed unusually silent, draped with long strips of white silk. Between the undulating pavilions and along the winding roads, faint traces of white could be seen.

The entire lake mourned as one.

"A pity..."

A streak of black light shot in from the east, slowing as it approached the lake. Only then did it reveal the figure of a man clad in black. He had a forthright appearance, yet the gloom in his brows made him appear burdened with worry.

His gaze swept across the horizon—streaks of white filled his vision. The funeral was exceptionally grand. Since the Li Clan had come to dominate the lake, there had never been an event of such magnitude. From a distance, it looked as though the entire lake lay blanketed in snow, while the sounds of weeping echoed faintly through the mountains and forests.

Lin Chensheng felt a trace of unease.

He was not familiar with Li Xuanxuan and had scarcely even heard the name. This fellow Daoist bore no heaven-shaking titles, unlike Li Xuanfeng, who had at least left some impression on his mind.

‘I only heard that he was Daoist Master Zhaojing’s great-grandfather, a figure whose presence once steadied the clan’s destiny...’

Although he knew that Li Quewan’s urgent summons was unlikely for the death of an old man, Lin Chensheng still dressed with care and cautiously descended toward the mountain upon the lake.

Even here, above the mountain forests—between the high platforms illuminated by Heavenly Light—the air felt desolate. The fluttering white flowers remained vibrant, yet they appeared tragic amidst the billowing silk banners.

"Is Fellow Daoist Suyun present?"

He asked softly, and soon a voice answered from within.

"So it’s Senior Lin? Please, come in!"

It was the serpent demon of Mansion Water who greeted him, now dressed in white robes. His usually defiant and sullen face was filled with the weight of sorrow, and his tone was listless.

"Please."

...

A woman dressed in white stood quietly among the mountains.

Li Quewan had long since subdued the grief in her heart, quietly studying the long slip in her hand. No one knew how long she had been staring—completely absorbed. When she finally started awake, a trace of daze lingered in her eyes.

Li Xuanxuan had passed away, and his body had been moved to the main hall. It should have been the busiest, most important time, yet the Li Clan’s divine ability users were away at war and could not return. On the lake, Li Quewan herself could not leave, so all matters had fallen to Li Jiangzong and Li Suihuan at the foot of the mountain.

Li Quewan could not help but feel guilt—but this was no time for guilt.

Li Suining, who stood beside her, was also grieving, yet he found a faint trace of solace.

‘At least for these arrangements... In my past life, I was here through the entire process. The old man never sought empty fame in life. Sentiment is what matters—it remains the same in any lifetime. To have a little less regret... that is the best comfort for him.’

In her trance, Li Quewan had already set the bamboo slip aside with care. Her slender, jade-like fingers brushed across its surface, revealing the characters inscribed upon it:

【 True Cinnabar Edict Profound Art 】

A complex look appeared in her eyes as she murmured softly,

"What a wondrous esoteric art... it truly has an affinity with me."

Li Quewan had once obtained a copy of the 【 Sand-Pointing Curse Art 】 from Owl Mallow Temple. She had found it unusual—and remarkably compatible with herself. Exceptionally talented, she had cultivated it on her own, without need for guidance or reference.

Now, this 【 True Cinnabar Edict Profound Art 】 before her was born from that very 【 Sand-Pointing Curse Art 】!

‘It seems to be a further elucidation of the Sand-Pointing Curse Art... and yet, it also feels as though a great cultivator of the Whole Pill Dao had comprehended that art so deeply as to innovate from it, giving birth to this new esoteric art.’

That alone was strange enough—but what astonished her even more was how the art bore countless traces harmonized with her own fundamental path, as if it had been crafted by a senior of the same lineage—someone who cultivated the Golden Scripture and was also versed in shamanic arts.

Her fundamental path was the Shamanic Talisman Dao.

That art had been bestowed by the Immortal Mirror itself.

With only a single glance, her heart trembled as if struck by thunder, and nearly all her doubts fell away.

‘Indeed... indeed... could it have been written by a fellow Daoist from the heavens who also cultivates the Shamanic Talisman Dao? The Dao-profundity within far surpasses mine, though it does not reach an earth-shattering realm. Perhaps it was the work of a Great Daoist Master...’

Her mind overflowed with speculation—but beside her, Li Suining remained perfectly calm.

This was what Li Quewan had written in her previous life.

Having learned from his prior attempts, he now recalled many cultivation techniques and wondrous arts. Yet time was pressing, and among them all, only this one suited the moment: swift, precise, and derived from a technique Li Quewan already mastered. She could grasp it at once.

He paid no heed to where Li Quewan’s thoughts had wandered. Picking up a brush and paper, he smiled lightly.

"Daoist Master... Daoist Master Lin has arrived?"

Li Quewan’s expression turned solemn.

"He returned from the north and has been guarding the Sanjiang area. When you mentioned it, I immediately sent someone to invite him..."

A flicker of complexity passed through her eyes.

The message Li Suining had sent from the north was simple, and his report now was equally concise:

"A Great Daoist Master from Western Shu is coming to attack. Daoist Master Lin’s life is in danger!"

At those words, her expression had changed instantly.

Lin Chensheng’s foundation was extraordinary—one could even call him a walking treasury. For a battle to reach the point of threatening his life, how could the great formation in the desert possibly remain intact? She herself might barely escape with her life through a secret art.

In the next moment, she was already weighing her options.

‘Stop Lin Chensheng from coming to help? Impossible... I can only respond through other means.’

And the crucial treasure Li Suining had mentioned was Owl Mallow’s 【 Un-harming Stone 】.

‘That artifact is one of Owl Mallow’s greatest treasures—a fine creation of the Whole Pill Dao renowned for its protective power. The Owl Mallow sect possesses countless treasures, and since they never anticipated a great battle, this one hadn’t been brought forth back then. If I can obtain it, it will surely prove invaluable!’

Li Quewan then composed a letter, claiming to suspect unusual movements in the west, and requested that he bring several treasures—placing special emphasis on the Un-harming Stone.

While she pondered, the Daoist Master had already arrived. Reaching the foot of the jade pillar, he looked at the two of them with deep emotion, cupped his hands, and said,

"My condolences."

Li Quewan sighed and returned the salute. Lin Chensheng opened his mouth, intending to offer words of comfort, but the woman’s expression was grave. She raised a hand to stop him and said in a low voice,

"Daoist Master... have you brought everything?"

Lin Chensheng looked up, a trace of unease in his eyes, yet he still nodded and replied softly,

"Everything is here."

He patted his sleeve and drew forth a slim register from his cuff. It fit within the palm, as thin as paper, faintly aglow with golden light—yet it felt immensely heavy in his grasp.

Lin Chensheng spoke with grave solemnity.

"Upon hearing Suyun’s call for aid, I brought the Tiger’s Frontier Shamanic Profound Manual from my temple. Whether it be the Un-harming Stone or the Profound Scripture Purple Register..."

He continued in a low voice, "Aside from the Heavenly Owl, which cannot be moved, I have brought all the great treasures of my Owl Mallow Dao to prepare for the coming battle."

As he unfurled the golden register, a surge of spiritual vitality rippled through the air. A dazzling bloom of spiritual radiance burst forth, revealing the Spiritual Treasures and Artifacts sealed within one after another. Not only was Li Quewan stunned, but even Li Suining, standing at her side, felt his expression harden as his gaze froze.

‘He brought everything?’
