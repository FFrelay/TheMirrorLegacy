# Chapter 1359: Name and Substance

Struck by the shout, Wen Daoping's mind went blank for a moment, leaving him stunned. The breath that had just settled in his heart, cool and comfortable, now surged back up, rushing to his head like a thunderclap along with his blood, turning his face a ghastly shade of pale.

Wen Daoping was a man of great seniority with extensive connections, and a descendant of a True Monarch to boot. He was used to flauting his status. In the past, Longkang Yao would always show him a degree of respect, but never had he spoken with such a tone!

Furthermore, Li Ximing was still watching from the side with cold eyes!

The old man's wrinkled face began to tremble, his lips quivering as he gnashed his teeth. Seeing his expression, Longkang Yao sneered and said,

"What is it, Elder Wen?"

Wen Daoping stiffened his neck and said,

"Since the Great Daoist Master has already aligned with Bright Yang, there is no need for this old man to say more."

Longkang Yao sneered again, and the Great Daoist Master set down his cup.

"Old fool, I show you respect because you are a descendant of the Wen clan. But if I drop the pleasantries, you are truly a disgrace to the Wen name. There were only three stalks of the Bud of Perpetual Spring in total, and you consumed one and a half to cultivate a mere three shameless divine abilities!"

He cursed.

"You run into the mortal world to put on a grand rituals, spouting all sorts of nonsense, and you have the nerve to report to Vast Plateau? You have the face to go back?! The gall to go back! Xu Jiaoyan is about to leave his grotto-heaven to come find you!"

As if doused by a basin of cold water, Wen Daoping's face instantly drained from ashen to white. Yet this old man, who hadn't bowed his head even before Bright Yang, was so thoroughly rebuked by Longkang Yao that he didn't say another word, slumping down in dejection.

Only then did Longkang Yao say faintly, "You are dismissed."

Li Ximing chuckled inwardly but maintained a pained expression. As he watched Wen Daoping leave, he mused to himself,

'Bud of Perpetual Spring, that sounds somewhat familiar. I've heard it's a top-tier spiritual item of the Horn Wood. It seems this old Daoist Master most likely used it to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, then stalled in his progress and consumed another half-stalk for cultivation…'

Longkang Yao, however, felt little satisfaction—he had, in fact, shown the old Daoist Master considerable respect. Otherwise, given the firestorm brewing in his heart, why would he let the matter end with a simple "shut up"?

His expression had softened considerably by now. Li Ximing took out the small flag, the Daoist scripture that flowed like Converging Water, and the deep blue storage pouch, placing them on the table with a sigh.

"Returning these items to their rightful owner!"

Looking at these things, Longkang Yao's expression flickered, and he slowly nodded. Li Ximing finally spoke, sighing,

"My family came from the south, earning many merits. When we pacified the lands below the Luo River[^1] back then, we formed some connections with Chun City. It was only later, when the great situation of the world changed, that we followed the radiance of True Qi to the north…"

Longkang Yao's mood eased somewhat, and he nodded slightly as he listened. Li Ximing continued,

"We were never mortal enemies… much less to the point where a Daoist Master has to fall. Daoist Master Yu already told me, from the great battle until now, it has only ever been about our two families…"

He sighed.

"I heard… that the Great Daoist Master has a Fu clan under his command that sowed discord, falsely claiming Daoist Master Gu was dead. Your junior has heard a little of this and won't presume to lecture the Great Daoist Master…"

He gritted his teeth and said,

"And on King Wei's side… I heard of a Pang clan that was showing off before the Great Daoist Master, even colluding with that Ye Tuji, intending to cause harm… but for some reason, they later fell into internal chaos…"

Longkang Yao shook his head, the suspicion in his eyes fading as he began to deliberate, probing,

"Daoist Master Zhaojing misunderstands. If not for the Pang clan's warning, a grave mistake might have been made!"

Li Ximing also shook his head. "That is not correct. Without the Pang clan, the Great Daoist Master would not have hesitated to come out for a meeting. The matter was initiated by the Fu clan seeking to stir up trouble. With or without the Pang clan, Daoist Master Gu would not have fallen. Now it is simply a matter of… right and wrong, black and white, being revealed in the hearts of men!"

Longkang Yao paused his actions.

The Pang clan's sudden defection had reversed the entire situation in an instant. Though proud, Longkang Yao prided himself on having some ability to judge character.

'It couldn't have been without reason. Pang Yi is ruthless and disloyal. He might have been plotted against by Fu He, but he would absolutely not stand on my side for some grand sense of righteousness… The Li clan's influence is behind this, nine times out of ten.'

This was one of his suspicions, yet the Li Ximing before him was remarkably candid.

'Right and wrong, black and white, being revealed in the hearts of men…'

Li Zhouwei was willing to come to Chun City, so Gu You's life was no longer in danger. Whether the Pang clan had colluded with Bright Yang or not was merely a matter of whether the Fu clan's true face could be exposed… What was the point of scrutinizing the other details?

Longkang Yao let out a soft breath. The Great Daoist Master made a rare concession, speaking softly,

"Since it is so, King Wei—what do you seek?"

Li Ximing was overjoyed. He lifted his head and said seriously, "What I seek… is nothing more than the safety of Chun City!"

At these words, Longkang Yao was silent for a long time. He gently shook his head, stood up, and turned away, saying faintly,

"That is my duty, not something for Bright Yang to seek. If Daoist Master Zhaojing uses such words to placate me, you are looking down on me too much!"

Li Ximing shook his head. He looked up with a serious expression, and with a light flick of his wrist, revealed from his sleeve an array of glittering, multicolored Spiritual Talismans concealed in his palm, saying softly,

"The command tokens required for the Purple Mansion spiritual formations of High-Peak City, the two passes, Mount Rao, and all the border passes of Gu Prefecture are all here!"

As soon as he spoke, Longkang Yao's body stiffened. He spun around abruptly, the five-colored Spiritual Talismans reflecting in his pupils that burned like blazing flames. His expression changed dramatically!

Li Ximing's meaning… this vast territory gained through arduous campaigns and walks on a knife's edge, this King Wei was willing to relinquish every last inch of it!

He said in disbelief,

"A feat of such magnitude, and King Wei is willing to hand it over!"

Li Ximing sighed softly and replied,

"It is not necessarily a feat!"

Longkang Yao fell silent for a moment, then gently exhaled. The oppressive feeling that had been trapped in his chest for so long was finally released, and a glimmer of hope even rose in his eyes as his hands clenched tightly for an instant.

Longkang Yao did not know what Li Zhouwei was planning, but if he could reclaim all these territories, no matter what, Chun City could at least be saved!

He spoke for the second time, asking with sincerity, "What are King Wei's demands?"

Li Ximing stood up, bowed, and said seriously,

"I hope that for the divine ability experts who followed us south, the prefecture will not hold them accountable, nor bring harm to their families. For the Daoist Masters who served Bright Yang in this battle, I also ask the Great Daoist Master not to press charges, but only to punish the true culprits!"

There was no way Longkang Yao was going to punish these people; this statement was at most a shield for Bian Fan, who was still guarding the great formation in the east, something he couldn't be bothered to even mention. He said,

"What else?"

Li Ximing laughed heartily.

"If I must name a request… then please allow this humble cultivator from the south to tour the prefecture, bring a few powerful treasures back with me, trace the origins of my bloodline, and appease the divine ability experts under my command!"

"Is that all?"

"Precisely!"

Li Ximing knew full well that the second request was the crucial one, and he couldn't help but feel nervous. Longkang Yao's gaze turned complicated for a moment. He was silent for a long while, his expression changing again and again, and no one knew what he was thinking, until he finally seemed to be in a daze.

He said in a low voice, "Daoist Master Zhaojing… I have a question… I wonder if you could answer it?"

Li Ximing's heart instantly leaped into his throat, but his face remained composed as he said:

"Please speak, Great Daoist Master!"

Longkang Yao said quietly, "How does… King Wei evaluate me, Longkang Yao?"

Li Ximing was slightly taken aback. He looked up and was about to say something when Longkang Yao stopped him with a wave of his hand. The Great Daoist Master's expression held a clarity born from deep thought, and his face was extremely calm.

"Zhaojing, there is no need for pleasantries, nor any need to provoke me… I want to hear the truth—about Longkang Yao, about Blazing Aridity Heaven."

Looking at the inquiry in the other's eyes, Li Ximing's demeanor also became serious. He considered for a moment, then said,

"King Wei said… The immortal path cherishes extremes. Today, reputation is held above substance; it is simply a necessity."

He spoke with sufficient tact, mentioning neither Daoist traditions nor any names, but Longkang Yao had already closed his eyes. He let out a soft breath and actually began to smile.

"Longkang Yao has preserved his name today; tomorrow, he will ensure King Wei does not lose substance!"

With that, he flicked his sleeve and laughed.

"Pang Yi!"

Instantly, the young man hurried in from outside the hall and bowed before him. The Great Daoist Master's face was wreathed in smiles, his gaze sharp as his vermilion, flame-like eyes fell upon him.

"Take Daoist Master Zhaojing for a good tour. I… will go and select some treasures… for King Wei!"

"Many thanks, Great Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing's heart pounded, a slow excitement building within him. Pang Yi, meanwhile, gave a sharp cry of assent and hurriedly led him out, passing through the overlapping, deep-red corridors. The young man's heart was already shaking uncontrollably.

'Personally… selecting treasures for King Wei?'

What kind of person was Pang Yi? He saw at a glance the goodwill this Great Daoist Master now held for that King Wei, and the wild joy in his heart was nearly impossible to contain. He was ecstatic.

'The great matter is settled! The two sides will no longer fight, and returning to Bright Yang's command will now be a matter of course!'

He lifted his head slightly, a surge of pride rising within him.

'For this great service to Chun City, I, Pang Yi, stand at the forefront. Who can compare?'

But the joy of a successful retreat did not cloud his judgment. Pang Yi had waited far too long for this opportunity without others interjecting. He turned his head openly and said softly,

"This junior has a question, and must ask the Daoist Master again…"

He narrowed his eyes slightly.

"I wonder who it was in Bright Yang's camp… that slandered my Pang clan!"

This probe of his was perfectly timed, just as negotiations between the two sides concluded, while Li Ximing was in high spirits and the Pang clan was no longer a crucial piece on the board. He was testing what Li Ximing knew!

But this Daoist Master Zhaojing remembered clearly.

'This kid is really meticulous, still trying to clean up the details at a time like this…'

So he gave a cold laugh and said:

"Young Master Pang asks far too many questions! Just you wait, there will come a time to deal with all of you properly!"

Pang Yi was stunned, his first reaction being that the Li clan had used him! But he understood in an instant that this Daoist Master Zhaojing must be playing along with him. Caught between amusement and annoyance, he could only feign a grit-toothed expression as he escorted him out. Once outside the hall, he flicked his sleeves and handed him over to Lu An.

Lu An, for his part, withdrew his meaningful gaze, clicked his tongue, and shook his head with a small smile. But when he heard Pang Yi relay Longkang Yao's words, his smile immediately vanished, and his heart trembled.

'Is this… a peace settlement?!'

'How could it be so fast?!'

His adopted son, Bian Fan, was still guarding Chefu at this very moment, and no Purple Mansion expert had been able to enter or leave that area… All the divine ability experts in the city had guessed a great battle was imminent. How could it just end!

Li Zhouwei had held a winning hand by not returning Daoist Master Gu. Even now that he had been returned, there was still a great opportunity to fight a decisive battle and return victorious. Why would he back down so easily?

He still found it hard to believe, filled with confusion and hesitation, but he maintained a calm nod. Beside him, Changyun wore a thoughtful expression. As they walked out of the hall together, Lu An finally smiled and said,

"My Gu Prefecture has many immortal residences… every one of them left behind by a True Monarch. From the Three Yin to the Twelve Qi, all manner of Daoist traditions can trace their roots back to a Daoist Ancestor…"

At this point, he had to pause for a moment before continuing,

"It's just that Emperor Wei… never came to this place, so a Bright Yang site is hard to find… Only a certain King Jing from the Wei era cultivated it, but during the Qi era, he was eliminated by men sent by the Qi Emperor…"

"What a pity…"

Li Ximing had no interest in any Bright Yang site… otherwise, by common logic, he would have had to beat around the bush for a while. He was secretly hoping the man would say there wasn't one. With excitement in his heart but a thoughtful look on his face, he said in a regretful tone,

"I am not familiar with the north and don't know of any residences of ancient immortals. I only heard Daoist Master Yu mention that his ancestor once left a residence here called 【Wenhuang】[^2], which holds the power of yin-yang transformation and the interplay of water and fire. He said that cultivators of the yin and yang Daos, and figures who control water and fire, all love to go there to comprehend and experience it…"

He shook his head and smiled.

"Don't laugh, fellow Daoist, but not only do I cultivate Bright Yang, I also have a fondness for alchemy. In my spare time, I also play with flames to aid in pill concoction. When I heard Daoist Master Yu's words back then, my heart immediately grew fervent!"

As he said this, Lu An immediately understood, and said with a serious face,

"What are you saying, Daoist Master! I have long heard that Daoist Master Zhaojing is Jiangnan's number one pill master, whose concoctions are of the highest quality and whose skill in controlling fire is masterful, handling several spiritual flames with the greatest of ease. You are far too modest!"

Li Ximing did have some reputation. While the part about fire control was indeed just rumor, Lu An had naturally heard of his fame in the Dao of alchemy, and so he smiled and led the way forward.

But while the speaker may have been casual, the listener took it to heart. Changyun, who had been standing with his hands clasped behind his back like an idle bystander, was now lost in thought. His gaze couldn't help but linger on Li Ximing's back, a strange light in his eyes.

'Wenhuang Residence?!'

Among all the famous figures in the world, who didn't know of the friendship between the former master of Wenhuang Residence and his own True Monarch!

'Lu An and the others have been away from the True Monarch's side for far too long and might not have thought of it at once. But Li Ximing comes from the south, and the first thing he asks is to go to Wenhuang Residence… He must know something!'

His interest suddenly piqued, his detached demeanor greatly diminished. He followed closely behind the two, and in just a few breaths, the group had swiftly crossed the stone-paved road and stopped before a small, dark residence.

They saw a stretch of verdant green, with black tiles and bluestone. It looked like nothing more than a small abbey built by an ordinary Daoist priest. Only upon approaching could one see several old pine trees planted in front of the abbey, rustling in the evening wind.

Changyun first raised his head and bowed very respectfully before the old residence, chanting a Daoist honorific, before he finally couldn't help but ponder.

'Wenhuang Residence… is just a small dwelling. Although my people have stayed in the south these years and deliberately avoided Chun City… logically, a person's passing is like a lamp being extinguished. It's absolutely impossible for any good treasures to have remained here to this day!'
