# Chapter 1309: My Vision, My Design (Part 3)

‘True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation...’

Boundless darkness swallowed heaven and earth, leaving only profound lights connecting the heavens above to the Underworld below, while beneath their feet the grotto-heaven ceased its collapse, and a dim grey flooded the vision of every divine ability wielder.

In that instant, the divine ability wielders standing upon the river surface froze mid-motion, like ten thousand statues in myriad poses; even the thunder and the rainstorm halted, all suspended in the moment the True Monarch struck.

The figure in the sky moved.

That immense Dharma Body, which filled the heavens and the earth, began to sway; the Hornless Dragon draped over its shoulder, blood seeping from its lips and fangs, opened its eyes, revealing a ghastly bloody hue as a power that sought to burst free gathered within the world.

"Xuan'nu..."

His voice traversed the formless void, carrying an overflowing Dao-rhythm that broke through the darkness, expressing neither alarm nor anger, but radiating a profound calm and cold.

"You are about to commit a deed that all under heaven will condemn."

These nine words, like a raging river, like a disemboweling sword, hammered down one by one into the darkness, striking the world until it trembled and the four realms boiled, carrying an indisputable authority.

Dongfang Heyun, however, stood quietly in the darkness.

The cracks on his face spread from his forehead down into his body like shattered porcelain, and from within those fissures shone the glittering light of Converging Water, allowing him to ascend empty air step by step, gazing toward the infinite horizon.

"Xuan'nu.."

His already demonic eyes gradually widened as his pupils contracted, transforming into pitch-black vertical slits; his sharp fangs made a grinding sound, and his fury suddenly froze upon his face.

The black-clothed man was standing right in front of him, his aged face a mask of complex emotions, seemingly joyful, yet also uneasy.

Yang Jinxin!

Yet he ultimately extended his hand, pinching two fingers upward while his remaining three fingers loosely formed a profound mudra, placing it with extreme elegance before his body.

In this world-upending instant, this Judge Yang of the Netherworld had drawn upon his mysteries to their utmost limit; his eyes turned a deep ink-black, staring fixedly at the Dongfang Heyun before him.

The color drained from the Dragon Monarch's envoy's face, the ferocious intent in his eyes slowly faded, and the pupils, having contracted to vertical slits, gradually returned to normal.

Yang Jinxin’s voice grew soft.

"My lord... this matter has nothing to do with the Hornless Dragon."

"There is no need for you to interfere."

The moment he learned of Valley Water's scheme, this Judge of the Great Tomb River, who had coveted it and had thus far stood by as if watching a play, made a completely unexpected move.

Exiled Qi resonance!

Yang Jinxin’s mouth curved slightly.

Valley Water verifying the Dao?

Pit Water halting the excess?

While these changes had certainly exceeded the Netherworld's expectations, they were also a pleasant surprise. It cared not for the rotation of Water Virtue—but Xiao Chuting was not what he once was!

He already possessed a great possibility of Dao-accomplishment!

Pit Water!

The orthodox position of Water.

Rather than probing Moongaze, why not probe Luoxia!

Even though the North was not Netherworld territory, Exiled Qi involvement was limited, and he had never communicated with Valley Water from beginning to end, Yang Jinxin still turned his coat without hesitation, standing behind this True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation, the Profound Matriarch of the Nine Heavens!

Dongfang Heyun’s aura, however, continued to surge as the light around him flickered anew, a dense chill filling his now-normal pupils.

"Yang Jinxin, you alone cannot stop me."

_Drip!_

The sound of a light raindrop echoed through the sky. With extreme abruptness, amidst all that was paused, the rain within the grotto-heaven began to flow again, dripping and pattering onto the frozen radiance of divine abilities.

Dongfang Heyun's body remained motionless, but his head suddenly twisted backward, moving the dark back of his head to where his front should be, his face now looking directly behind him, seeing that azure light which pierced heaven and earth.

‘Du... Qing...’

True Monarch Lushui!

This Golden Core had come from the south, and in an instant, was already standing in the profound darkness!

In that moment, the heavy rain in the world suddenly turned violent, striking the metal-like sea surface, bursting into a light azure color, as a bone-chilling sneer brewed in his eyes.

Amidst the surging azure light, the pitch-black sky simultaneously gained another color.

A streak of white.

The comet star had arrived.

This streak of white was like a sharp sword, magnificently streaking across the sky, splitting the pitch-blackness in two. The sounds of martial calamity and chaos resounded through the heavens, rolling and spinning, making the azure light even brighter.

Taiyue.

The two lights arrived together, and that wisp of aura connecting to the world beyond was severed; the boundless light of Converging Water failed to descend, and Dongfang Heyun's figure blurred for an instant, almost dissipating like smoke and clouds between heaven and earth!

But the cold sneer on his blurred face only intensified as he gazed at the ever-changing Pristine Water in his vision, his pale white fangs opening and closing.

"How rare."

"You dare not drive me away."

Correct.

With two True Monarchs and one Judge present, this incarnation of Dongfang Heyun should have scattered like smoke and returned to the Eastern Sea, yet a thread of profound mystery remained.

‘It’s them, the disciple-brothers.’

Although Du Qing, as True Monarch Lushui, had been suppressed by the Dragon-kin to the point he could not leave the mainland, it did not mean this True Monarch Lushui was without means; on the contrary, this junior disciple-brother Du Qing was the most resourceful of the Six Scions of Chongming!

Was He here to help Valley Water and destroy the True Dragons' foundation?

‘Water has five virtues: Valley, Pit, Pristine, Converging, and Mansion; He presides over Pristine Water... although the positional changes of water are relatively stable, He is proud and arrogant, and has long desired change.’

As Valley Water, Xuan'nu wished to advance further, hiding the Boundless Ocean to help Pit Water achieve Dao-accomplishment. As long as Xiao Chuting succeeded, She, to protect the merit of Valley Water, would absolutely have to hide the Boundless Ocean', no matter where.

What was left for Du Qing?

The eternally incomplete Mansion Water and the Converging Water that his Hornless Dragon descendants had controlled for ten thousand years.

Valley Water achieving the Dao Embryo would certainly damage the prestige of His Hornless Dragon lineage. Du Qing could not agree more with this point, and from the perspective of this True Monarch Lushui, it was best for the Hornless Dragons to fail.

But they could not be allowed to fail in such a manner, as if defeated by Valley Water!

How could He allow Himself to fall into an even more passive situation?

And was He here to obstruct the Dao and help the Dragons?

‘No.’

The cold sneer in Dongfang Heyun's eyes intensified.

‘He is here to kill the body.’

The Dragon-kin envoy's eyes shone brightly.

‘For Him, Du Qing... what is the best option?’

Mutual destruction.

Valley Water succeeds with great difficulty, Xiao Chuting perishes immediately upon achieving Dao-accomplishment, and both the Dragon-kin's prestige and Valley Water's merits are damaged simultaneously—that is His true goal!

At the instant Pit Water achieves Dao-accomplishment, release Dongfang Heyun, allow the Dragon Monarch to intervene in this situation, so that Converging Water and Valley Water will both be grievously wounded, leaving Him, Du Qing, more breathing room!

And Beijia—even knowing this, he had to accept it in order to salvage the situation!

As if confirming his suspicions, at the highest point of the sky, all the Pit Water had already condensed into a single point. The white-haired old man was no longer subject to any interference, the Metallic Essence before him remained bright, neither increasing nor decreasing, and all the colors of heaven and earth converged upon him, about to draw down the profound mystery.

All these changes made Dongfang Heyun's expression even colder. He just quietly watched the sky, gazing at the illusory splendor of Metal Virtue hidden in the darkness, the iciness on his face shattered, and a trace of a smile actually flashed in his eyes.

‘It seems it's not just this.’

Amidst this lightning-fast collision of changing layouts, all the arrangements not only condensed the objectives of the various True Monarchs, but also simultaneously pointed to that deep, bright color seated high in the sky.

Sky Glow.

‘It’s not just achieving Dao-accomplishment in the orthodox position, there is also a Dao Embryo... the former Azure Profoundity Dao Embryo.’

‘In that case.’

Everything re-congealed.

The shimmering Metallic Essence, the grey Valley Water, the surging spiritual in...

The Fruition Attainment ceaselessly approaching that Metallic Essence..

The True Monarch standing tall in the sky...

Everything, all of it, congealed at this moment.

The anger and coldness in the Dragon Monarch's envoy's eyes, originally as heavy as a lake, shattered like a stone cast upon a thinly frozen surface, then dissipated like smoke, leaving only calm.

‘This matter is already not something that can be resolved by the mountain dispatching a Divine Core... or even a Golden Core.’

The darkness ended here.

Clouds began to appear in the boundless heavens, the vast earth emerged in their vision, and a profound voice came from beyond the sky.

"Xuan'nu."

"You have overstepped."

The Valley Water in the sky showed no surprise, just as tranquil as when She had acted. From the most silent and soundless position to stirring the winds and clouds of the world, borrowing the strength of all parties, calling forth the grandeur of the Sky Glow, only now was Her jade-like voice heard.

"My lord, do you wish to be stained by the mortal world?"

As Her last word fell, surging Valley Water rose from between heaven and earth, swallowing all the Sky Glow and the land, causing this realm to once again plunge into roiling darkness!

"This Venerable One does not defy the Master's command."

In the darkness, twelve points of Sky Glow, bean-sized, lit up.

Merely twelve points.

But these twelve points of Sky Glow grew from the size of rice grains to become blindingly brilliant, drawing near from extremely distant places, transforming into twelve colored threads, and the utterly thick darkness and grey were all split apart by these twelve points of Sky Glow.

Thus, the sky filled with flying rosy clouds.

Be it Pit Water or Pristine Water, Exiled Qi or Cultivation Transcendence, all vanished. As far as the eye could see, only twelve pillars of light connecting heaven and earth remained, their edges joining, as if one were inside crystal and glaze.

Only a speck of grey remained at the end of the horizon.

Was it Valley Water?

Xiao Chuting did not know.

He only felt time resume its flow upon his body and finally heard the profound voice that echoed through the sky.

"Since you do not wish This Venerable One to interfere, then let the old world judge."

He saw the glazed, colored light tremble, and something from the distant horizon responded, stretching out its limbs bit by bit, gold and purple emerging together, coalescing before his eyes.

This object was half a metre long, with a round face of one metre, purple-gold entirely, tinged with the color of bronze. Countless azure-gold profound patterns undulated on the drum's body, while gold and silver long sticks stood nearby, shining brightly.

A Dharma Treasure!

A Profound Thunder Dharma Treasure!

The instant this object appeared, the Metallic Essence in the sky stopped undulating. That silver long stick leaped into the air and slammed down on the drum's colorful, undulating surface, and an azure-gold color immediately emerged!

This color was like a mirror, reflecting endless scenes of blood; mountains of corpses and seas of blood rose and fell within it, perhaps a great prefecture annexation, a clan extermination, or a lone, desperate battle, an unwilling fall, or endless demonic clouds, where not one in ten survived...

Countless scenes reflected in his gaze as the vast, deep sound of the drum rippled out, continuous and unending, transforming into one wave after another of purple-gold thunder, crashing down, causing the Metallic Essence in the sky to vibrate ceaselessly, its colors diminishing, instantly appearing dim!

But his accumulation was simply too deep.

Every wisp of atmospheric resonance in the sky was nurturing his prestige. Among all practitioners of Pit Water, past and present, he, Xiao Chuting, had already reached the apex of 'Position Follows Peril'!

Even as the thunder fell time and again, shaving off layer after layer of colored light from his speck of Metallic Essence, a profound and wondrous power still surged, firmly attracting the Pit Water Fruition Attainment in the sky, refusing to retreat.

In the next instant, the golden long stick brightened.

This object leaped up, fast and fierce, smashing into the very center of the drum face, as if it had been restless for a long time, carrying enmity and hatred, swift as divine thunder from the nine heavens; a dense golden light exploded with a bang!

All the scenes around him distorted.

It was an immortal mountain soaring into the clouds, a pair of profound peaks facing each other from afar, the pond water clear, spiritual qi drifting, white clouds flowing between the mountain forests; before this incomparably familiar scene, Xiao Chuting heard a very soft voice,

"Xiao Chuchou, do you hate me."

These seven words seemed even louder than the golden thunder in the sky, illuminating the old man's face, making it obscure. He heard a gentle voice.

"There is nothing to hate, it was simply unavoidable... Back then, I abandoned the family and left. I imagine you hate me even more for that."

Xiao Chuting knew where this was, and knew who this was.

The Mount Xianyou of that year.

His elder brother, Xiao Chuchou.

_BOOM!_

The sound of furious thunder echoed by his ear, as if wanting to tear his body to shreds; he suddenly saw his own face illuminated by the bright thunder, that face was already very old back then, not much different from today.

He said,

"The haze in the Great Void is too thick; I have been alarmed and fearful ever since. On countless painful nights, I still have to ask myself: Xiao Chuting, today, are you yourself, or are you some Purple Mansion Realm Golden Core, some Maha Dharma Master's tool?"

_BOOM!_

The golden thunder illuminated everything for an instant; the old man saw the golden light in that burning divine ability flicker, that Metallic Essence he had striven for his entire life, pursued his entire life, finally compromised, splitting apart, and the grey light belonging to 'Darkening Clouds' was extracted unceremoniously.

A sarcastic smile began to appear on the old man's face, those fragments of dialogue flowing out like a meandering stream, snowflakes filling the sky. Xiao Chuting stood beside the him of that year, watching his brother's body wither, shriveling into a pile of bones.

This borrowed divine ability, stained with blood and tears, had once allowed him to lead his family to gain a firm foothold, to constantly maneuver between two great Daoist Traditions, to carve out his own space bit by bit... but its basis reached its end today, following that fallen brother, turning to nothing beneath the flashing Profound Thunder.

The esteemed position was so close to him, yet in this instant, it completely transformed into a distant, unreachable eternity, disappearing along with his brother's life-mandate amidst the hazy lightning, becoming a final end point in his long and complex memories.

"Brother."

He turned his head, looking at the self standing in the mist above; those two pairs of aged eyes overflowed with the exact same sorrow and solemnity, slowly closing, lips moving slightly, as two voices, separated by two hundred years, began to merge.

"You and I have no path to walk, you and I have no path to retreat."

"CLANG—"

Xiao Chuting of the Xiao family... this ambitious hero who seized his brother's divine ability for his own use, this Great Daoist Master who walked out of a small southern prefecture, this talent who played the geniuses of the great Daoist Traditions from his humble background, this prodigy who walked alone to the brink of Golden Core and even the Dao Embryo, blurred into a cloud of black mist amidst the multicolored light—a cloud of black mist that scattered like dust in the thunder.

Valley Water retreated from the distance.

The sound of thunder roamed through the mountains, rising and falling in the Sky Glow, covering everything, dragging out all that was hidden beneath the endless falling snow, and purging all impurities.

Those five hundred years of laughter and tears, hatred and sorrow, dreams and illusions, all finally turned to smoke and clouds, finally departing with all the flowing impurities.

Reduced to dust and ashes.

# Acknowledgments

Good evening, everyone.

Xiao Chuting's story has come to a temporary close. It proceeded relatively smoothly, without any deviation from the outline's trajectory. The foreshadowing was all laid down around chapter two hundred, and now it's time to tie up the loose ends, allowing his mortal story to conclude for the time being.

He represents the Li family's early, extreme conceptualization of divine abilities, and he is also a top-tier figure. Whether in strength or reputation, he was worthy of appearing before the Dao Embryo. Even in death, he is beyond comparison to any other.

Furthermore, although Valley Water was heavily injured, her designs on the Dao Embryo do not stop there; much foreshadowing has yet to be revealed, but none of it is meant for so early in the story. My writing process involves following a detailed outline that is built upon the main outline.

Looking back now, "The March Upon the Huai, The Crossing of the Ji" is already over two hundred chapters long, and it is time to end the volume. There is still a small block of content remaining, but waiting to finish that small block before ending the volume would feel unsatisfying. Having learned my lesson from Vast Cicada, it is better to give Xiao Chuting a volume conclusion right now and merge that small block of content into the next one.

However, this means changing the volume title again, which is an old tradition of mine. I would rather change it than have an indistinct volume division. "Pacifying Xiang on the Huai" or "Entering Danger on the Huai" were both good options and were considered for this volume..

My ideal plan is for the entire book to be divided into 5-6 major volumes, and "The March Upon the Huai, The Crossing of the Ji" was also a good name for a major volume.

After much consideration, I plan to take five days to organize things for this volume's conclusion. The 9th is conveniently a meeting day, so I will organize the outline during the meeting. I will try my best to finish the Li family's story in two volumes, three at the most. The entire book should only have two or three volumes left. The name of the final volume was decided long ago, but the name for the next volume has been stubbornly elusive. Thinking of volume titles in advance is truly a difficult task...

Thank you all for your support.
