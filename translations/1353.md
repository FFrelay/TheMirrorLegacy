# Chapter 1353: Three Questions

The Buddhist light was resplendent.

On Mount Dayang, a brilliant splendor bloomed with lotus flowers. Within a small courtyard, a soft, golden light drifted like wisps of fog. A monk in yellow robes sat within.

He sat with his legs crossed, perfectly stable, a cup of tea in hand. Lost in thought, he spoke casually,

"So, in other words... Gu You... will indeed die at his hands."

Kneeling before him was a monk who appeared quite frail, his hands pressed together in prayer. A single point of silver light flickered incessantly at the center of his brow, making for a unique sight. With his head bowed low, he spoke in an extremely soft voice,

"Yes... it should be so... but..."

He raised his head, a trace of hesitation flashing in his eyes as he murmured,

"This disciple feels... that this time, Gu You will likely not perish."

The seated monk raised an eyebrow.

"And what makes you say that?" he asked coolly.

Fan Kang had now entered the Buddhist path, having attached himself to this Lamp Chief's command. His destiny was a special one; merely by this association and without ever having studied the scriptures, he had swiftly attained the position of a Merciful One.

Yet it was precisely at this moment that he experienced a sudden enlightenment, regaining his perception of the Heavenly Element!

As he awoke from those myriad illusions, the confidence and sudden clarity of his previous awakenings were gone, replaced by an incomprehensible confusion and unease. His knees shifted slightly on the ground, betraying his extreme panic.

His vision swam with a chaotic mess of images. In a momentary lapse, it was as if the swirling Radiant Fire still danced before his eyes, filling him with both terror and hatred.

It had to be said that compared to that madman Qi Lanyan, this Lamp Chief took far better care of him. In the life he just experienced, Fan Kang had offered counsel from the shadows, instigating disputes and stirring up tempestuous waves. While he couldn't claim to have achieved any great successes, his own life was at least out of danger for the time being.

The fall of those with divine abilities in Gu Prefecture was, of course, not unrelated to Fan Kang's schemes.

'What a pity. In the life before last, I was beaten to death by Li Zhouwei right there on the mountain. In my last life, I awoke in time to escape, but because of that prior failure, I knew far too little about the events that followed...'

After that information had been wrung from him, the Lamp Chief paid him no further mind. He did not mistreat him, however, instead tossing him into the Way of Great Desire.

During the great war between Yan and Zhao, the temple where he resided was breached. The man who walked upon the blazing Radiant Fire strode inside. The memory of that bizarre scene still made his heart pound with dread.

Raging Radiant Fire illuminated the temple. Xiaodisa had fled long ago, leaving him to cower alone in the main hall. The golden-eyed youth stepped inside, lifted him with that golden spear, and pinned him to a stone statue. Smiling, he asked,

"You are the Merciful One of the Heavenly Element, Fan Kang?"

Knowing his life hung by a thread, he replied in a trembling voice,

"I greet Daoist Master Changli!"

The youth then unexpectedly sat down by the stone platform as if they were old friends reuniting after many years. Counting on his fingers, he proceeded to ask him three questions.

The first was:

'Where do the borders of the Wei lands end?'

He didn't think too much about it, simply choosing to give the answer from his first life.

"They end at Qilu in the east and the lands of Yan and Dai in the north".

The youth seemed to ponder this for a moment before asking,

"After Bright Yang's attainment, was the Golden Land added?"

He had been shattered to pieces in his second life, so how could he possibly know so much? But fearing he would be deemed useless and killed by the man before him, he dared not remain silent.

"I have not seen it!'

The youth then rose from his seat, a sneer flashing in his eyes as scorching flames baked every corner of the temple. He lifted Fan Kang up and said,

"Good. Now let me ask you this: after Bright Yang's attainment, did a secret realm fall into Moongaze Lake?"

Fan Kang was utterly clueless about this question as well. He simply followed the precedent from his first life, puffing out his chest to feign confidence.

"It did!", he declared.

Daoist Master Changli was greatly disappointed. He gathered up the terrifying flames, churning the very heavens and earth until it felt like the world was spinning before Fan Kang's eyes. Scared out of his wits, Fan Kang hastily cried,

"My lord! My lord! I am useful! Please spare me... Just take me back with you! I can contribute to your plans; one or two more suggestions will surely be a benefit, my lord!"

But the raging inferno did not pause in the slightest. As death rushed toward him in a dizzying whirl, Fan Kang heard only the man's great laughter.

"Suggestions? A scurrying rat, a treacherous cur, a two-faced traitor—you would only defile my esteemed ears!"

At this moment, these memories flooded back like a tide, making his entire body burn with heat. His Highness had asked three full questions, not one of which concerned whether Bright Yang would succeed, only what happened *after* his attainment. Fan Kang simply could not understand why he had been asked these things, nor could he fathom what this Daoist Master could have possibly gleaned from the answers.....

He, who had not even cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm nor ever experienced a divine ability, could not think of a single thing to say in rebuttal to this genius's cool judgment. It left him with nothing but a stomach full of suffocating resentment!

Now, it felt as if that fire was still flickering in his heart. This fear and unease quickly morphed into an endless, boundless rage. He gritted his teeth and thought,

'Li Jiangqian... you refuse to believe me... You will get what you deserve!'

This momentary lapse was misinterpreted by the Lamp Chief, who became quite displeased.

'If not for the fact that you are of the Heavenly Element,' he sneered inwardly, 'I would have scoured your soul and obliterated you long ago. A stray dog dares to put on airs before me!'

The disciple knocked his head on the floor and cried out,

"Back when I was under Master... under Qi Lanyan's command, things were also proceeding smoothly. But at every critical juncture, a variable would appear. Even then, this disciple felt something was amiss, but Qi Lanyan stubbornly refused to listen to my words!"

"My lord, King Wei must have someone of the Heavenly Element in his service!"

"Oh?"

To his surprise, the Lamp Chief before him also revealed a flicker of disdain. He looked down upon him, his expression strikingly similar to Qi Lanyan's all those years ago.

He said only, "Heavenly Element? Ridiculous! How do you think that man surnamed Liu was ruined? If he hadn't taken that trip on the lake, would he now be clinging to outdated methods, cultivating some half-finished, mindless Vault Metal? There is something unusual about Bright Yang, something beyond the calculations of your Heavenly Element. Your predictions are naturally unreliable."

Faced with this remarkably similar response, Fan Kang felt as if he had grasped something, yet he was unable to distill any conclusion from the words echoing in his mind. He could only raise his head and repeat the same words he had once spoken to Qi Lanyan.

"Then that person is in the Song Court! Or somewhere else! In any case, such a person must exist!"

His words were resolute.

These words, after all, came from one of the Heavenly Element. In ancient times, a promise or a mere utterance from one such as him would have been enough to become a fortuitous opportunity sought by thousands, a pointer toward a shortcut to Dao-accomplishment. Spoken with such a tone of certainty, the statement carried immense weight!

The Lamp Chief's origins were exceedingly noble, making him one of the most prominent figures on Mount Dayang. Yet, faced with the confident pronouncement of a Heavenly Element scion, he found himself half-convinced and half-skeptical, and fell silent for a moment.

Fan Kang had already lifted his head, his eyes filled with a sinister chill. He shuffled forward two steps on his knees and knocked his head forcefully on the ground twice before the monk.

"This disciple dares to swear upon the Buddhist Land! There are absolutely traces of a Heavenly Element's influence around King Wei! And I am surely not the only one who suspects this; there may well be others testing the waters. This disciple asks for nothing else: if Gu You truly does not die, or if the coming battle on the lake is averted, I implore Master to never doubt me again!"

The Lamp Chief stared at him for a long time. As one of the most senior figures on Mount Dayang and an important minister of the manifested Dharma Aspect, he was naturally aware that Fu Tanjian would soon descend the mountain and largely understood the arrangements being made.

After a long moment, he finally said in a low voice,

"Then we shall wait and see!"

"Thank you, Master!"

Fan Kang knocked his head hard against the ground twice more. A vicious venom and a soaring fighting spirit finally refilled his being. Countless thoughts, each more complex than the last, flashed through his mind.

'The last time I had a Heavenly Element perception, you schemed against me, allowing that King Wei to kill me so carelessly. I lost far too many opportunities to gather information, leading me to accomplish nothing of note all this time. It won't be like that again... Having escaped that fatal blow, I have seen so much more with this new Heavenly Element perception!'

He lifted his head and gazed southward, as if staring at his rival on the lake.

'I won't truly die anyway... I can always start over... All of you... you all look down on me. The situation is different now. Just you wait!'

...

"King Wei.."

A brilliant Heavenly Light streaked across the sky, swiftly manifesting above the mountain pass. A man in black robes emerged, stepping down from the void. The people below bowed their heads in unison as Li Jiangqian stepped forward and clasped his hands.

"Father!"

Li Zhouwei let out a soft breath, his expression revealing nothing of his mood. He scanned the area and said,

"Daoist Masters, you may return to your duties."

He did not elaborate on the outcome of the negotiations. No matter how intensely curious the Daoist Masters guarding the ramparts were, they did not dare to ask, and so they departed one by one on streams of light.

Li Zhouwei, however, walked with a steady gait, quickly arriving at the main hall. Li Jiangqian and Li Ximing entered with him.

Only after the heavy doors were sealed did Li Jiangqian bow and say with some hesitation,

"Father... I saw that the sky over Chun City was filled with Converging Water, with few signs of a major battle. But I fear many variables were at play, and it will be some time before the situation inside is resolved."

Li Zhouwei nodded. He had not returned in a great hurry and had observed much of the situation in the sky.

"Gu You and Longkang Yao are now enraged. A rift has formed between the two traditions—our great undertaking is accomplished!"

The crimson-robed youth was not surprised by this. He merely smiled and said,

"It is as it should be. To protect himself, Pang Yi would naturally want the rift between the two traditions to grow as wide as possible. That man is a true villain, endlessly treacherous and wicked. He is skilled at stirring up storms but possesses only the venomous cunning for destruction, not the ability to control the outcome. Placing him here was the perfect move, as there is no fear of him turning the heavens upside down!"

All things considered, the current situation was hardly worse than having conquered Chun City with ease.

Li Zhouwei said with approval, "That is true. Without that father and son, the result might not have been nearly this effective. At most, we would have made them suspicious, but not driven them to the point of a complete rupture. When this affair is concluded, do not be stingy with their reward."

His eyes showed a mixture of joy and regret as he shook his head.

"This matter ends here. For it to conclude this way is already an excellent outcome."

Although he coveted that fragment, he also understood the principle of slow and steady progress. Moreover, after careful consideration, he had already left himself other avenues to acquire it. Not attacking now did not mean it could never be his!

He then turned his head and said with a serious expression,

"The next matter, I will leave to Grand-uncle."

Li Ximing nodded with a great deal of admiration.

Leaving behind Gu You's many treasures was, of course, a way to provoke Longkang Yao, but more importantly, it was to create the opportunity and conditions for Li Ximing to enter Chun City and negotiate!

'Now, we need not fight our way in; we can talk our way in!'

The bargaining chips in Li Zhouwei's hands were exceptionally plentiful, extending far beyond the treasures found on Gu You's person. He also held the prefecture city, its spiritual formations, and the four strategic passes of Gu Prefecture!

'We were going to withdraw eventually anyway. These places must be returned to them sooner or later; it is merely a question of how.'

Li Zhouwei had no interest in plundering the area and destroying the city and its formations. After all, these great formations were the culmination of a thousand years of accumulation by the great houses. In the future, each one would be a bastion he would rely upon to secure his land's borders. If he destroyed them today only to reoccupy the land tomorrow, what would he use for defense?

Thus, in his entire campaign in Gu Prefecture, Li Zhouwei had only destroyed Mount Jiao, the one with the weakest foundation, and only out of absolute necessity.

He lowered his voice, his divine ability carrying his words as he said softly,

"We can ask for nothing, returning everything to their hands in Gu Prefecture completely intact. This will allow them to protect themselves to the greatest possible extent during our absence... And such generous terms, of course, must be exchanged for something of value from Longkang Yao..."

It was as if Li Zhouwei and his people had already seized the entire fortune of the Gu Prefecture houses but were forced to withdraw temporarily, leaving it in their care. If, in doing so, they could still obtain what they desired, why would they not?

The King of Wei said quietly,

"Longkang Yao prides himself on his immortal nobility, yet he was schemed against so easily. I suspect he has no true backer; the Blazing Aridity Heaven is likely more name than substance. All he truly relies upon is the reputation of his ancestors."

He reminded them,

> This part has some mistakes and ambuigity.
```
"The honor of his ancestors is the very shield that protects the lives of the entire Longkang clan, far more precious than any personal gain or loss. A man like that would rather suffer a tangible loss than lose face; he cannot tolerate humiliation... Thus, as the ancients held a feast in the Wanling tomb, so today does the Supreme Yang draw a blade to let its own blood—both are merely drinking poison to quench a thirst, actions born of necessity."
```

Li Jiangqian agreed with admiration,

"Someone with true power, like Golden Oneness, simply accepts failure when a plan does not succeed. After all, it is only their own face that is lost. With a True Monarch at their back, their fame is endless, so they would naturally sacrifice face to preserve substance. Or take Wandering Metal, who simply removes themselves from the situation and ignores everyone—who would dare try to drag them into the fray?"

"If Grand-uncle goes there willing to trade for peace in the four territories, then since Longkang Yao has involved himself, the dignity of Chun City becomes his own. To preserve that noble dignity, he will surely not be stingy!"

Li Ximing nodded silently. The King of Wei said no more, but everyone present understood the unspoken meaning.

It all depended on the caliber of the treasure in that box, whether there would be an opportunity to ask about it, and if he did ask, whether he had the right to take it!

Li Zhouwei considered for a moment.

"You will need someone to accompany you... I was originally inclined to choose Wu Miao. Although that fellow can swallow his pride and is a smooth talker, he is too shameless to stand firm before Longkang Yao... But there is another..."

Li Jiangqian hesitated for a moment before hearing his father say, "Changyun."

After Li Zhouwei's victory, a considerable number of people had temporarily submitted to him, but choosing a candidate was not easy. Changyun appeared to be a rogue cultivator, but in truth, his experience and background were profound.

More importantly, since Taiyuan might be connected to the master of the Wen Huang Residence, True Monarch Taihong, bringing Changyun along could be advantageous. By sounding him out in conversation, they might glean some information from him or use the connection to their advantage!

Li Ximing seemed to have a premonition. Hearing the name, he nodded thoughtfully, clasped his hands in salute, and departed.

Only then did Li Jiangqian ask, "What should we do now?"

Li Zhouwei said, "We cannot act rashly. First, we will concentrate our divine abilities on the two passes to give your great grand-uncle a stronger negotiating position. The immediate crisis in Gu Prefecture has been resolved. Neither Gu You nor Longkang Yao have the standing to leave the city and challenge us to battle now. Even if another Great Daoist Master were to appear on their side, it would merely serve as an additional bargaining chip."

"As for me....."

He rose from the main seat and walked step by step toward the hall's entrance, an icy look finally surfacing in his eyes. He clapped his hands together, strolled down the steps, and said faintly,

"I am going to see Yang Ruiyi."
