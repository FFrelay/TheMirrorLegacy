# Chapter 1282: Attaining Truth

This ancient Wei-Li artifact was truly different from those of the present day. It was not like the commonly used storage pouches but rather resembled an accessory, lying sparkling in his palm and making Li Jiangqian's eyes light up.

However, when he probed it with his spiritual sense, he found the divine ability lock within was sealed tight, making the ever-cautious man hesitate.

'If this were a modern storage pouch, I could just tear it open with a divine ability and connect to the Great Void to take everything out. But this is an ancient artifact, after all; who knows what kind of measures might have been left behind…'

Li Que'wan retracted her fire, flew over, and said with a smile:

"How rare, it's a Guarded Glaze Molten Fire."

Li Jiangqian was not particularly interested in Molten Fire and only glanced at its form before nodding in satisfaction and sighing:

"Great-Granduncle won't be going home empty-handed."

Her brother was seen holding out his hand to pass the object over; the woman accepted it, turned it over for a closer look, and quickly said:

"It is said that the art of storage is tied to the Wandering Metal. That great figure achieved the Dao in ancient times and roamed free while avoiding the mortal realm, experiencing few vicissitudes, which is why storage artifacts have been usable through the ages… This object was forged by the Wandering Metal."

Her Whole Pill state was not suited for combat, but she always seemed to have connections to various Dao lineages and was also close with the Metal Virtue. After a moment's thought, she continued:

"It's actually not difficult to open."

She said with a smile:

"There is a saying, 'Harmonising and Vault Lock. Harmonising Metal gathers and stores, while Wandering Metal contains and holds.' They appear similar, but the difference is immense. Harmonising Metal, much like Converging Water, is a domineering sort that is unwilling to disgorge what it swallows; in ancient times, it was used to forge dharma artifacts that would confiscate an enemy's weapons. Wandering Metal, however, can both receive and release, is unperturbed by fortune or disgrace, and avoids karma, which is why it is used for storage…"

"As long as the owner has perished, it becomes much easier to activate."

She was then seen forming a technique seal and tapping a few places on the stone ring. Pinching off a bit of Geng Metal, she dipped it in Pristine Water, dotted a few key points, and chanted:

"The vault locked by Harmonising holds no metal prize; since you are in the mortal world, why in seclusion lie?"

The iridescent light of Awaiting the Supreme Divine flowed out. Protrusions appeared on the stone ring as if in response, attempting to fall into the light of Awaiting the Supreme Divine. After only the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, a host of items poured out!

"Incredible!"

Li Jiangqian exclaimed in praise, while Li Que'wan flicked her sleeve and gathered all the miscellaneous items that had rushed out, leaving only the Purple Mansion Realm-level objects behind.

The most numerous items were, surprisingly, scrolls and jade slips of all sizes!

Li Jiangqian casually picked one up. It felt soft to the touch; the scroll was like woven gold, its patterns dense and intricate. It felt strangely familiar, and in an instant, he realized he had seen something similar before:

'Great-Granduncle's Radiant Qilin Refining Art!'

The scroll before him was at least seventy percent similar to the Radiant Qilin Refining Art. It even felt slightly warm in his hand and was completely unguarded; with just a gentle shake, the bright golden characters within were all revealed.

The Profound Yang Administrative Sutra!

The young man swept his gaze across it and was stunned to discover it was a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method. The divine ability it cultivated was called the Chariot of the Presiding Office.

'I've never even heard of it…'

His interest was instantly piqued. He observed it carefully, and after a long moment of contemplation, he came to a conclusion:

"So it's a derivative of Crimson Severing Arrowhead… It must have been created by the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate, a lesser divine ability specifically distributed to Bright Yang cultivators…"

Although Li Jiangqian cultivated Radiant Fire, he had carefully studied several of the Bright Yang divine abilities:

"This so-called Chariot of the Presiding Office, compared to Crimson Severing Arrowhead, lacks the killing intent and air of conspiracy, making it appear righteous and obedient. It was transformed from a Yang Cusp divine ability that could execute rebels from afar and assassinate monarchs into a lesser art for punishing criminals under orders. It only retains the characteristic of moving like the wind to traverse karmic debts, capturing the form but not the spirit."

Although this item was no longer of great use, it was an excellent choice whether for his two elders to study or for his subordinates to cultivate. He immediately put it away, and when he turned his head, he found his sister holding a crimson scroll, staring at him expectantly.

"This is…"

"I can't open it…"

Li Jiangqian was Li Zhouwei's biological son, so opening a scroll or two was naturally as easy as turning his hand. Li Que'wan, however, was denied access, feeling a bit ashamed. Li Jiangqian's pair of golden eyes moved slightly, and he took it with a chuckle, discovering that this scroll was rather special, crimson all over, and painted with patterns of leaping flames.

He gave it a gentle shake, and with a rustle, the secret scroll in his hand unfurled:

Sutra of the Profound Sire and Heavenly Molten Fire!

A look of surprise appeared in his eyes.

"It's actually the Dao of Molten Fire! It seems to be quite profound, it's Sire of the High Mounds…"

He casually passed it to his sister. The two siblings had a clear division of labor and sorted through everything one by one, only then discovering that the Daoist scriptures this person carried were truly astonishing.

'Bright Yang divine abilities: Audience with the Celestial Gate, Eternal Brightness Steps, Luminous Heart, and Chariot of the Presiding Office…'

'Bright Yang is one thing, but there's also the Molten Fire's Sire of the High Mounds and Receiving the Blazing Flute.'

Besides these, there were also quite a few artifact refining methods and pill formulas. There was even a secret art, called the Method of the Second Manifestation of Attaining Truth.

This art was surprisingly not recorded on a scroll, but on a piece of brocade about a foot square, placed in a vermilion box and preserved with extreme care.

Li Jiangqian read it. The main point of this art was to use the marvels of Bright Yang to verify True Fire, thereby giving birth to techniques. It seemed more like a knack. The young man pondered for a moment and said:

"This person probably fled back from somewhere. These things should be the Daoist scriptures from another region. He carried them all with him before he left, but unfortunately, his injuries were too severe, and he never handed them over before he died."

Li Que'wan, however, was very interested in this Method of the Second Manifestation of Attaining Truth. She formed a seal to imitate the art. After quite a while, she managed to produce a thumb-sized flame, which made her expression strange and filled her with heavy doubt.

She said strangely:

"Perhaps my Dao-Profundity is too shallow to understand the subtlety of this art, or perhaps this art is incompatible with the current era. When I sense it with my divine ability, I only get a tiny spark. Looking at it, let alone using it in a divine ability battle, even Qi Refining cultivators would find it too weak."

Her words piqued Li Jiangqian's interest. He read the brocade, also extended his hand, and tried twice before seeing a small spark between his fingers.

Li Jiangqian frowned and said:

"It is indeed peculiar."

He wondered aloud:

"This spell art is obscure and its effect is extremely poor. It looks familiar to me; perhaps it's one of those ancient Immortal Dao methods of consuming qi and nourishing one's nature, of feasting on rosy clouds and drinking evening mist. It is difficult for us of the Purple and Gold Dao to use."

The two studied it for a while but couldn't solve its mystery, so they could only put it away for the time being.

The rest of this person's belongings seemed to have been mostly used up when he was severely injured. Only two portions of the Geng Metal spiritual resource, Autumn Dew, and one portion of the Converging Water spiritual item, Nine Children Converging Feather, were unusable and thus survived.

Autumn Dew belonged to Geng Metal, so Li Que'wan could use it. This Nine Children Converging Feather was a good thing, a full palm's size, with an extremely dense aura of Converging Water, definitely not an ordinary item. Li Jiangqian handed it to her as well, saying:

"Creating the mystic realm is important. This item will surely be liked by Daoist Master Liaoluo of the Qusi. You take it for now; it will definitely have a use."

The secret arts, mind-incantations, and even travelogues and anecdotes besides the cultivation methods had passed through long years and were actually of considerable value. Li Que'wan treasured them the most and collected them all. Only then did Kuang Hong ride the wind forward and say softly:

"The earth veins have been stirred. This subordinate will garrison this place and comb through the fire vein."

The Li family had the Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam, which could actually gather atmospheric phenomena. If they had prepared the Heavenly Nurture Urn, they might have been able to collect some spiritual resources. But the Li family's goal was of course not these few spiritual resources. Que'wan even took out a box and instructed:

"Originally, there should have been a Molten Fire cultivator to warm and nourish the earth veins, but the family has no Molten Fire cultivators. King Wei obtained three portions of Molten Fire spiritual resources from the mystic realm. You prepare them for now. If there are any unstable places in the earth veins, you can feel free to inject one or two portions to make it abundant and achieve profound unity!"

This spiritual resource could at most be refined into a dozen or so pills, but if this land was well-nourished, it could support more than just one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Kuang Hong also knew the key point and nodded with a solemn voice.

Li Jiangqian said with a smile:

"You all followed Father north and should naturally be rewarded. His injuries have not yet recovered, and he is in emergency seclusion. He has already ordered us to exchange for spiritual resources that correspond to each of your Dao lineages. I shouldn't overstep my authority, so I have only done my best to collect them. We will wait for him to come out of seclusion before bestowing them upon you."

Both Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangqian had actually kept this matter in mind. However, the establishment of the Li family's Profound Foundation mystic realm was imminent, so naturally, nurturing the Profound Foundation came first. After that, there was still the Great Tomb River. So they might as well wait for both matters to be concluded, and then give out rewards with the surplus.

But when Kuang Hong heard his words, he was almost ashamed. He bowed and said:

"Your Highness says I have merit, you truly flatter me. In the matter of Luoxia, if it weren't for King Wei, who knows how many of us would have been injured or fallen. King Wei, all by himself, fought until all of Luoxia trembled in fear. We people just followed behind, merely waiting in different places. I cannot see where my merit lies, so how could I have the face to accept a reward…"

He sighed softly, took the spiritual resources, and rode the wind down. The smile on Li Jiangqian's face grew wider as he said:

"Daoist Master Yin's sincere heart is truly rare."

Li Que'wan was just about to speak when she suddenly noticed blazing flames to the south, their color rushing to the sky. A faint laughter could be heard. She immediately turned around, both surprised and delighted, and said with a smile:

"The Molten Fire has landed, Great-Granduncle has succeeded!"

As if in response to her words, clouds drifted in the southern sky, the cry of a phoenix was heard, and streaks of golden light shot straight into the heavens. The two Daoist Masters quickly moved over, just in time to see the old man Ji An with a ruddy complexion and a face full of joy, clutching his chest and sighing, on the verge of tears, saying:

"Daoist friend Li! Daoist friend Li… this time it has finally succeeded!"

"It's a success!"

Li Ximing rode the Heavenly Light, a jade box held in his hand, and said with a smile:

"Congratulations, congratulations!"

Ji An took it with trembling hands, opened it gently, and glanced inside. He saw a crimson pill with golden patterns sitting within, felt the spiritual qi of Radiant Fire rush towards his face, and said in a hoarse voice:

"It is… it is… it's finally a success!"

The Li family members didn't feel it, but Ji An had spent the last few years on Moongaze Lake feeling restless, worrying every single moment. If a battle broke out somewhere, he was afraid someone would fight their way to the lake and destroy his pill. He was also afraid that he would have to rely on the Li family and be forced to act, only to end up with his body destroyed and his Dao extinguished.

Now that he had weathered the storm and seen the light, and his ascension to the Purple Mystery was at hand, how could he not be excited? The old man just sighed and said:

"I've troubled you, Daoist friend… with so many complicated matters these past years, to have you always waiting by the lake, Ji An feels extremely guilty."

Li Ximing smiled and shook his head. When the old man saw the celestial phenomena in the sky, a look of nervousness appeared on his face as he said:

"Now that the pill is complete, I must immediately send the Dangwood Molten Fire over. If I am even a moment late, I will have slighted the Upper Sect."

The Dangwood Molten Fire was borrowed from the Golden Oneness, so the Upper Sect Ji An spoke of was naturally the Golden Feather Sect. This rogue Daoist Master was so respectful that he didn't dare to delay for even a moment. He took the spiritual fire from the reluctant Li Ximing and carefully put it away.

He hesitated for a moment, then looked at Li Jiangqian. His gaze held both remoteness and gloom as he said softly:

"I remember Your Highness said you wanted to discuss the Dao of Radiant Fire with me… but with the current situation changing and my lifespan dwindling, I'm afraid I cannot keep that promise."

"If we meet again, I will surely have four divine abilities and will impart them with all my heart. If I go without a sound and leave no trace for a hundred years, then this Wu has broken his word and sacrificed himself for the Dao. There is no need to be concerned."

When Li Jiangqian heard this, he was slightly startled, and a rare sincerity appeared on his face as he said:

"Senior's divine abilities are vast, you will surely succeed."

Ji An laughed heartily and said:

"I know my own situation best. I've heard that ascending to the Purple Mystery of Radiant Fire is not considered difficult among the Five Virtues, yet it has held me back for over a hundred years. This shows how low my Daoist wisdom is…"

After laughing, he bowed to the three of them.

Li Ximing sighed in his heart, his expression complex. He watched him bow, take his leave, and disappear into the Great Void, then silently shook his head and said:

"I think even if he succeeds, he won't have time to cultivate a fifth divine ability. He's not doing this for the Quest for Gold to extend his life, but only to fulfill his own wish. He is also a great cultivator seeking the Dao."

The two were silent. Whether it was Xiao Chuting or Ji An, the Li family was coming into contact with more and more great cultivators, and their hearts for seeking the Dao seemed to get firmer and firmer. The atmosphere in the mountains became inexplicably heavy. Li Ximing sensed this, immediately smiled, put on a look of great regret, and joked:

"What a pity, what a pity… The Golden Oneness has also learned its lesson; it's become afraid of me. It insisted that Ji An take the flame away as soon as the pill was refined, only mentioning the pill refining. This Dangwood Molten Fire is truly the best spiritual fire I have ever seen."

Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian looked at each other and smiled. The woman extended a slender hand and said with a smile:

"It's no pity!"

When Li Ximing saw the flame in her palm, he was at once surprised and delighted. He gently took it, and the flame that had just been captured by Li Que'wan was refined in an instant!

'Guarded Glaze Molten Fire?'

Li Ximing was both surprised and regretful, saying:

"A fine treasure, the only pity is that I'm not skilled in artifact refining!"

This Guarded Glaze Molten Fire was quite famous in the Dao of artifact refining, especially in ancient times. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of that era most commonly used this fire. Although it had no special marvels, in the discerning eyes of ancient cultivators, this fire was widely sought after by Purple Mansion cultivators because its flame was stable and gentle, allowing for long periods of refining.

And it was precisely because the flame was stable and gentle that this fire was also not bad for the Dao of pill refining, just not as full of spirituality as the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire.

But Li Ximing sensed it carefully and found that the fire before him seemed extraordinary. He immediately raised his head to meet Li Que'wan's smiling gaze, and sure enough, he heard the woman say:

"This was originally a Molten Fire, taken into that senior's divine ability and nourished for a full thousand years within the roiling Molten Fire divine ability. It received immense nourishment and is much more vigorous than an ordinary fire!"

"I'm afraid it would be difficult to find another such Guarded Glaze Molten Fire in the world!"

She said with a smile:

"Now, not only has its power increased, but I think its marvels in pill refining are also a notch above the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, and its marvels in artifact refining have improved even more."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly and praised:

"This too is a fortunate encounter."

Li Que'wan smiled and reminded him:

"But… this has been nourished for a thousand years. A vigorous fire is easily damaged. This fire must be cherished and protected, and should not be harmed by someone's divine ability. On normal days, if it's not in use, it's best to keep it inside your body or a container, to preserve its Molten Fire phenomena!"
