# Chapter 1289: The Accomplishment of Liang

When Li Jiangqian heard this, he smiled and said,

"This is only to be expected. After all, Luoxia has already been completely emptied..."

Li Ximing rose to his feet, his fingers pinching together in calculation as he added more fire beneath the furnace; the East Life-Mandate Vase in his palm flickered, and a stream of clear water poured out as he asked,

"How is your divine ability progressing?"

"I have made some small gains."

Li Jiangqian replied with considerable modesty, saying,

"I wouldn't dare delay your affairs, Great-Granduncle."

Li Ximing extended two fingers, using the East Life-Mandate Vase to stabilize the pill furnace, and headed toward the lake with him, saying,

"Mastering a divine ability isn't a matter of just a few years, and it's the same for Que'Wan. If another great battle occurs in the Great Tomb River, I fear it might damage her immortal foundation, so there is no rush for her to come."

The Daoist Master in white-gold robes shook his head and sighed,

"These three years... not so long, yet not so short. There have been some disturbances. The Yang Clan took Overlook Peak and seems to have ambitions toward the Eastern Sea. They've rotated several people over there, leading to some friction with the Chunyi Dao Gate."

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow.

"That was bound to happen. The Xi Clan has remained uninvolved for many years. If not for the Chunyi Dao Gate having its own designs, the Yang Clan wouldn't have tolerated the situation for this long."

Li Ximing said helplessly,

"This news actually came from Xuanyi... there wasn't the slightest ripple about it outside. He came this time for two reasons: first, regarding the help you promised him, I provided him with a spiritual resource to exchange for an item of Converging Water; second, there is news about the Vast Earth Treasure Heart Jade."

The Vast Earth Treasure Heart Jade was a relic of Kong Tingyun. After the Profound Peak Gate was exterminated, Kong Xiaxiang presented it to the Li Clan. As it was an item related to the Comprehending Profoundity, Li Jiangqian entrusted it to Xuanyi for disposal.

"This Daoist Master found a cultivator within a Grotto-Heaven and had it sent back. Xuanyi said... the recipient wasn't particularly interested and only counted it as a personal favor, so he found something himself to compensate us... But he is short on resources and couldn't produce a spiritual item, so he had to look elsewhere."

Li Ximing's expression turned slightly odd, but he stopped in front of the grand formation and retrieved a scroll from his sleeve.

The scroll was pale white, about an arm's length, with golden rods. Though it was not unrolled, the white and gold interwoven header already bore purple characters:

_Diagram of Orthodox Thunder Transformation_.

Li Ximing casually handed it to Li Jiangqian, shaking his head as he said,

"I heard... this item was obtained by Xuanyi's grandmaster, that Daoist Master Qu, from the ruins of a thunder palace called the Starling Thunder Palace."

Li Jiangqian frowned and asked, "A Spiritual Artifact?"

Li Ximing shook his head.

"It's not quite like a Spiritual Artifact. While it has some marvelous properties, its physical body is extremely fragile, like plain paper. The slightest carelessness could tear it to shreds. If you want to use it, you must protect it with a divine ability."

"As for those marvelous properties... it only has one function."

Li Jiangqian raised his eyebrows, looking at Li Ximing as he spoke, "Storing thunder."

He continued, "This item's body is like paper; water or fire would destroy it instantly, yet it has no fear of lightning. Not only is it unafraid, it can actually contain thunder!"

"It's somewhat like a formation diagram..."

Li Jiangqian nodded, intrigued, and immediately understood.

"The Demonbane Cleaver Mace!"

"Exactly!"

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly and said,

"I reckon he rummaged through everything he had and just couldn't find anything good enough to compensate us. Most of his grandmaster's belongings couldn't be touched, and our family doesn't lack for ordinary spiritual resources. Using those to offset the value of a Spiritual Artifact would cost too much. After thinking it over, he must have realized we possess the Demonbane Cleaver Mace, and only this item would be useful to us!"

He smiled.

"Fortunately... it's really quite good. I've tested it. This item can store two strikes of Punishment Thunder for several months!"

Upon hearing this, Li Jiangqian's eyes lit up, and he praised,

"Excellent!"

The Demonbane Cleaver Mace actually wasn't bad; the problem was that the Li family lacked a Purple Mansion Realm expert specializing in Profound Thunder. The only one capable of forcibly using its mysteries, Li Que'wan, was unskilled in thunder techniques...

One must understand, the thunder palace of old was exceptionally prosperous, developing countless variations of lightning arts that formed their own system, hence the specialized term "Thunder Methods."

In the Li family's hands, the Demonbane Cleaver Mace was like a pearl gathering dust. Its primary combat ability, Thunder-Quell, could not be brought to bear, yet the extremely obscure Punishment Thunder still played a critical role—when Qi Lanyan died back then, that single strike of agonizing Punishment Thunder decided the outcome of the entire situation!

Although this Punishment Thunder was unique, the trouble was that it required accumulating thunder clouds in advance. When Li Zhouwei fought the great battle at Lake Xian, he had the home-ground advantage, which is the only reason he had the opportunity to use it. If one were attacking far from home, it would lose much of its effectiveness.

"In that case, a major drawback of this artifact has been eliminated!"

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"As long as the Punishment Thunder is used in conjunction with other spell arts, its disruptive effect will undergo a qualitative leap... Furthermore, this artifact has a fourth, even more powerful mystery when in my sister's hands. If we had her store a strike within it, even we could make use of it."

He paused briefly, a look of regret soon crossing his face as he said,

"It's a pity... we only have the Demonbane Cleaver Mace. If our family possessed an even more precious and powerful Profound Thunder Spiritual Treasure to pair with this Diagram of Orthodox Thunder Transformation, it would surely produce a similar qualitative leap..."

Li Ximing nodded subtly and offered a reminder,

"There is one caveat: this item is used instantly in combat. If it is damaged, it is permanently destroyed. Moreover, there is no concept of it recognizing a master. If you are careless and it is snatched away by someone else's divine ability, it might even be used against us."

As the two stepped out of the Great Void, they saw a new high platform erected in the center. Flames raged atop purple-gold pillars, and people bustled back and forth in a hive of activity. Batches of spiritual resources were being refined all around before being transported away, hurrying toward the central platform. As far as the eye could see, not a single idle person was in sight.

The high platform was quite spacious. In the center stood a great cauldron, as tall as a man and requiring ten men to encircle it, covered in abstruse profound patterns. Surrounding it were numerous profound pools, filled with flowing Golden Essence, spirit water rippling with clear light, and black baleful energy soaring like crimson flames... They were too numerous to count.

A Daoist Master stood with his hands clasped behind him, his expression grave as he stared at the green cauldron. Following the calculations of his fingers, a Cinnabar-red divine ability flowed, and various spiritual resources were cast into the cauldron, converging within.

It was precisely Cheng Qian.

The Daoist Master was not the least bit distracted and had no time to acknowledge the two, his entire being focused on the task. From time to time, golden command talismans would fly out from the inner formation and land in his palm, providing adjustments and guidance.

Li Ximing, his feelings mixed, said in a low voice,

"It has been your sister and Daoist Master Cheng Qian handling things, while Daoist Master Kuang Hong travels back and forth to the Southern Sea... There was some trouble earlier—the Milin earth veins shifted, and one or two extended into the lake, causing some fluctuations."

"Fortunately, the trouble wasn't major. With your sister overseeing the calculations, she made a slight adjustment and managed to add several types of Pure Qi. Aside from that, during your three years in seclusion, the family has expended four Purple Mansion-grade spiritual resources and one Horn Wood spiritual item. Below the Purple Mansion level, resources like Golden Essence, fire toxins, spirit wood, and cold balefires have been consumed endlessly. The cultivators below haven't extinguished their spiritual fires in three years; they've burned out furnace cauldrons, and it's still like a bottomless pit..."

Li Ximing paused, sighing emotionally.

"Our family manages its affairs well and has a surplus every year, but in just three years, thirty percent of all spiritual resources below the Purple Mansion Realm have been drawn away like flowing water!"

The Li Clan has many cultivators and many spirit fields, resulting in high output but also high consumption. Yet, proportionally, their annual surplus has always been far greater than other families. They also plundered a great deal from Luoxia, so their current savings are extremely deep. Thirty percent might not seem like much, but it's equivalent to half a Purple Mansion grand formation, enough to support countless cultivators!

Li Jiangqian had also managed the family's affairs and understood the significance of this expenditure, but he didn't feel distressed. He merely sank his spiritual sense into the cauldron and immediately perceived a bright white embryonic form, only the size of an egg, yet possessing a vibrant, rhythmic pulse of life.

He turned his head and said with satisfaction,

"It's not that much at all. If we can use resources below the Purple Mansion Realm to assist a divine ability, then no amount is too much."

Li Ximing was still pondering.

"Regarding the agreement we reached with the Xinggong Terrace to trade for Wall-Sinking Water, totaling six pools, we were to use our family's resources for the exchange. The first three or four pools came quickly, but the last two dragged on until two years ago, when the matter was finally settled... Times are different now. By supporting one less Xinggong Terrace, our resource consumption has also slowed."

"Of these six Neck Feathers, three were traded to the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition for Bright Yang spiritual resources, so we could continue refining the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill for you. The remaining three are with the clan."

Li Jiangqian frowned.

"Is the Wall-Sinking Water from the Western Sea also becoming hard to find?"

"It's not quite that bad. It's just that the Xinggong Terrace is being suppressed by that West Mansion Grotto Sect. They've been having an increasingly difficult time in recent years, and their disciples don't dare to venture out casually, so naturally, they've lost their connections."

He looked somewhat worried as he continued,

"The Wave-Suppressing Mansion is conspicuous by nature. Without a Purple Mansion expert guarding it all these years, other cultivators have been hesitant to make a move. But if this drags on, I fear there will be trouble."

Li Jiangqian pondered for a moment before speaking softly,

"This is a time of great upheaval. We might as well dispatch a Purple Mansion expert to the Eastern Sea... make some preparations... and dismantle that formation."

The Neck Feathers provided by the Wave-Suppressing Mansion had once been a vital harvest for Li Ximing, providing a constant lifeline to the destitute Li Clan, which hadn't even possessed a single spirit embryo... But as the situation changed and became clearer, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion seemed increasingly beyond their reach.

'It's simply too far from the mainland. There's no secret that can be kept forever, and our family's collection of Wall-Sinking Water over so many years has become increasingly obvious. Many Purple Mansion experts in the south already have their suspicions, and I fear it's only a matter of time before word reaches the north... The Dragon-kin are untrustworthy. Sending a dedicated Purple Mansion expert just to guard that place is putting the cart before the horse, uselessly creating a vulnerability...'

'Dismantling a formation is a terrible waste; plenty of people have no formation to set up at all, so trading it to others would be most appropriate. But this formation is unusual; there is a treasure suppressing things beneath it. Our family doesn't lack spiritual resources, so we might as well dismantle the formation to retrieve that treasure at its base, and grab one or two other spiritual items while we're at it.'

Li Jiangqian was decisive, but Li Ximing looked somewhat regretful as he replied,

"The Great Tomb River is the Chen Clan's mystic realm; it certainly contains Wall-Sinking Water. We can still make use of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion one last time to convert these harvests. Doing it later won't be too late."

Li Jiangqian hesitated a moment, then said,

"Grand-uncle's words are reasonable."

As he pondered this, Li Ximing still felt the sting of the decision, racking his brain for a solution. Unexpectedly, a crimson radiance sped toward them, stopping and bowing in mid-air to reveal Li Zhouming, dressed in red.

Li Zhouming's talent was poor. Back then, he had behaved like a profligate dandy, partly because he believed he could never reach the Foundation Establishment Realm and was too lazy to waste time and resources. Later, stuffed with resources and relying on the support of his father and older brother, he luckily managed to establish his foundation. His cultivation after that, however, progressed at a snail's pace, even though Li Xuanxuan had privately taken out treasures, hoping he would advance further.

But Li Zhouming's Foundation Establishment had been a fluke, let alone cultivating further. Whenever this topic came up, he would righteously refute them with words like "Don't waste resources on me just because I am a Daoist Master's grandson."

Li Xuanxuan didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and knowing his talent was indeed low, eventually gave up.

Now, a junior in the family had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, and even his wife had long since broken through to the late stage, yet he remained lackadaisical, stuck at the early Foundation Establishment Realm. Seeing the two Daoist Masters, he was quite excited and said,

"Grandfather! Grandfather... Your grandson went to Milin and found no one. Aiyo... I've finally found you..."

There was laughter in Li Ximing's eyes, but his tone was habitually reproachful as he said casually,

"You've been in the Foundation Establishment Realm for so long, yet you still have no sense of propriety."

Li Zhouming looked embarrassed. Suppressing his excitement, he bowed and said,

"Esteemed Daoist Masters, someone has arrived outside the lake! It's... it's... the Duke of Li!"

Hearing these words, Li Ximing was startled, but he reacted in an instant. The joy in his eyes intensified, and he excitedly took a step forward, staring at him as he asked,

"You mean... Jiangliang?!"

"..."

He was a Purple Mansion expert, after all. The sheer pressure from that emotional fluctuation made Li Zhouming feel suffocated. He hurriedly said,

"It's just... he didn't enter. He only stopped at a small peak on the eastern border..."

As Yang Zhuo's most trusted subordinate, Li Jiangliang held the dual posts of Grand Emissary of the Profound from the Palace of Revering Martial Arts and Emissary of the True Light Cloud. Within the Great Song's official hierarchy, he was already extremely esteemed. He was also the Founding Duke of Li Province and the Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace, having reached a point where there were almost no further honors to bestow.

The "Duke of Li" spoken of by the world was precisely him!

Years ago, he had taken his leave from the lake and returned to the Imperial Capital for seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Now that he had suddenly appeared, what else could it be but good news? Li Ximing burst out laughing, overjoyed.

"So, he has accomplished his divine ability!"

'No wonder he didn't come directly to the lake...'

Li Jiangqian, however, raised an eyebrow and nodded with a faint smile.

"Among my younger brothers, I always saw him as the most promising. Sure enough, he is the first to achieve this... There was no news from Jiangnan, so it seems he came straight to the lake right after exiting seclusion. Excellent, excellent..."

The golden-eyed youth stepped forward and smiled.

"It's been many years. Time to catch up!"

The old man and the young man brought Li Zhouming along, using their divine abilities to travel. In an instant, they crossed the Milin Mountains. From a distance, they spotted a mount landing on a peak, and just as expected, a person was standing there with his hands clasped behind his back.

This person had an extraordinary bearing. He wore blue-purple robes, and behind him flickered a raging Radiant Fire. A Li-Light radiance shone from his heart-mansion, and specks of starlight spontaneously emerged from the Great Void around him, landing on the hem of his robes and the tips of his hair.

It was precisely the Great Scripture of Radiance!

Among Li Zhouwei's sons, only Li Jiangliang and his eldest brother cultivated the same technique, the Scripture of Heavenly Radiance and the Waning Sun. Now that he had achieved his divine ability, his body also raged with Radiant Fire and the radiance of orthodox nature. Unlike his elder brother, however, his divine ability was faintly mingled with the bright white light of True Yang, making him appear even more vast, righteous, and inviolable.

Beside him stood a woman in blue-black robes. Her face was pretty, and she stood half a step behind him, a respectful smile on her lips.

Li Jiangqian arrived, treading on fire. His own golden eyes, comparatively narrower, were bright with joy. He grabbed his younger brother's hand and clapped him on the shoulder, smiling as he said,

"Incredible!"

Li Jiangliang, having passed this trial of life and death and broken through all illusions, was similarly overcome with emotion. The feelings in his golden eyes were genuine as he clasped his hands in salute, his voice slightly hoarse.

"Greetings, Grand-uncle, Elder Brother!"
