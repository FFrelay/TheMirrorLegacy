# Chapter 1337: Upheaval at High-Peak

"He..."

This Great Daoist Master appeared in the heavens, his voice resounding through the four quarters, bringing the various divine abilities clashing in mid-air to an abrupt halt. The Divine Ability cultivators raised their heads, somewhat dazed, while the Qi family Daoist Master fighting bitterly against Liu Changdie suddenly changed expression.

"How could it be this fast!"

This person was named Qi Lanjin, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Qi clan currently stationed in High-Peak City. He had long known what kind of disaster that clan brother of his had provoked outside, and his heart was trembling with fear. His first instinct was to pull up his legs and flee, yet he realized he could not escape in time. He gritted his teeth and froze in place; even the Lesser Yin light flickering in the sky ceased. He then heard a soft sigh. The Converging Water cultivator beside him, Yu Xixin’s clan nephew Yu Heng, had already lowered his head, bowing to the ground with an expressionless face, saying,

"I am willing to die for King Wei!"

In that instant, all gazes were cast upon Qi Lanjin. His face alternated between green and white; he could only lower his head and bow down following this Daoist Master of the Yu clan.

Only then was King Wei heard speaking from the air, "No need for strict ceremony."

In an instant, the flames filling the sky dissipated, and the various lights and colors upon the grand formation dimmed. The crowd was either sorrowful or joyful, yet all retreated to the sides; only Qiao Wenliu raised his head, narrowing his eyes.

'Yu Xixin... what is the meaning of this!'

One had to know that although Yu Xixin was not as capable as Longkang Yao, he was still a Great Daoist Master of Gu Prefecture. His Purple Qi might be lacking, but his First Omen of the Dao was renowned... How long had the two been entangled in mid-air? Had it even been fifty rounds?

Li Zhouwei was certainly formidable, but to say he could force Yu Xixin into a desperate situation within fifty rounds—that was virtually impossible!

'Could it be... Yu Xixin had the intention to surrender from the start?'

But if that were the case, Qiao Wenliu felt a measure of displeasure.

'Since there was an intent to surrender, why hold out for two extra hours? If he had stormed out in feigned anger earlier and surrendered upon being surrounded, both sides would have looked good. We gave him so many opportunities earlier, yet he insisted on holding out for these two extra hours only to surrender hastily. He has lost face, and we have lost time. Just to preserve some sentiment, he doesn't even care about his own reputation!'

One had to know that these two hours were already a very long period of time—reinforcements from Chun City would not even need two hours to arrive here. It was merely that the retreating Longkang Yao was perhaps wary of his injuries, or perhaps thought the Yan Kingdom would intervene, and had indeed gone south...

'But what if they had come? He nearly ruined my grand plans!'

His desire for revenge was heavy, and his actions were even more urgent than King Wei's. These two hours spent constantly guarding against reinforcements had been agonizing. Yet his mind was agile, and he possessed a somewhat arrogant nature, not easily subdued by ordinary people. With this temperament rising, even though Yu Xixin was a Great Daoist Master with an excellent reputation, he did not give him a shred of face. He sneered and stepped forward to welcome him, saying,

"You really follow good advice as naturally as a river flows; congratulations, Daoist Master Yu! Please open the grand formation and welcome the King's carriage inside."

Yu Xixin had suffered a swift defeat in a single night and damaged his artifact; his heart was full of bitterness. Being ridiculed like this for no reason, he had nowhere to vent his frustration, and he was seething with anger. However, his shrewdness ran deeper. He accepted the insult without wiping it away, neither refuting nor getting angry, and laughed.

"Yes, it is not suitable to speak much outside. Please!"

Thus, golden light flashed, and this majestic city finally slowly unveiled its veil. As the Great Daoist Master took a command token resembling a golden sword from his sleeve and delivered it into Liu Changdie's hands, this majestic northern city was finally declared to have changed masters!

Purple mists spread out like a staircase, and rich spiritual qi rushed against their faces, causing even Li Zhouwei to marvel secretly. The figures of the Divine Ability cultivators drifted into the Profound Hall high above, only to see Qiao Wenliu seeming filled with emotion, saying gravely,

"Great Daoist Master! How stubborn was the defense of the city, yet how godspeed was the surrender; fate is truly hard to predict."

These words made Li Zhouwei frown, sweeping his golden eyes over him. Facing these words, Yu Xixin narrowed his eyes and laughed.

"Have you not heard the saying, 'True Dao Immortal Cultivators, removing their crowns and clipping their wings'? Beneath the Heavenly Gate, the True Purple cannot escape. The Wei Emperor exterminated the True Dao Sect and razed the various lineages to prove his imperial might is boundless. Since there is the precedent of the True Monarch, is it not only natural that I am defeated by the hands of Bright Yang?"

Everyone present was well-read in the classics and possessed deep Dao-Profundity. His statement was not without basis. Li Zhouwei and Yu Xixin understood this most deeply. During the battle of dharma arts, the Bright Yang divine ability had struck at his weak points at almost every turn!

Having heard these few words and seeing Qiao Wenliu's dissatisfaction, Li Zhouwei spoke softly:

"This King weilds an orthodox artifact of Bright Yang, capable of executing spirits and ghosts. Daoist Master Yu simply did not wish for mutual destruction and the suffering of living beings..."

With King Wei personally explaining and saving face for him, Yu Xixin’s mood relaxed considerably. Qiao Wenliu barely nodded, the anger in his heart finally dissipating, and said no more.

Li Zhouwei, however, was in a great mood. He had preserved the grand formation and gained the service of a Great Daoist Master. The mountain that had been pressing on his heart for days finally collapsed, leaving him feeling completely at ease.

He, Li Zhouwei, had penetrated deep into enemy territory alone—for what purpose? Was it not to gather surrendering generals and occupy majestic cities... What could be more precious than a Great Daoist Master?

Although Yu Xixin was not particularly formidable in fighting techniques—if not for his divine abilities and spell arts being suppressed by Li Zhouwei, he absolutely could not have been taken down so quickly—as long as he had such a figure in hand who could temporarily block another Great Daoist Master for him, the room for Li Zhouwei to maneuver would be much greater!

After all, for such figures, the candidates that Gu Prefecture could mobilize at one time were merely a few!

Not to mention this High-Peak City—its earth veins and spiritual vitality were extremely majestic. It was the place where Emperor Zhao had fallen. With the grand formation intact, as long as it was held in his hands, it was an excellent trump card.

His thoughts deepened as he took his seat at the head. However, a Daoist Master had already turned around, abruptly kneeling before him, bowing in salute, drenched in cold sweat, saying,

"King Wei! The Qi clan is guilty!"

It was precisely Qi Lanjin!

This sentence silenced the great hall. The other Daoist Masters were not surprised, knowing this tribulation was inevitable, and all remained silent. Only Yu Xixin looked like he wanted to speak but stopped, his gaze holding a trace of worry.

Seeing King Wei raise his eyebrows above, "What crime is there?"

"The matter of Yangfeng... the sin lies with my Qi clan. I, as the elder brother... failed to discipline him!"

This answer was known to everyone. Qi Lanjin bowed again, whispering,

"My grandfather was originally a prodigy of his generation, but he fell while seeking the Dao, leaving only my father and his brothers. Among the sons, Father loved him especially. Back then, he overruled all objections and chose him to enter the mountains to cultivate... Later, my father also fell, and my uncle took charge."

"Unexpectedly, he failed to absorb qi for ten years and grew despondent. When he met my uncle, he refused to bow his head. My uncle already hated him for wasting the opportunity, so he ignored him from then on. He also acted high and mighty, stubbornly going towards Guanhua, and from then on was no longer close..."

"Later, he achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, and only then did he become somewhat affectionate with the family again... but ultimately, the estrangement was greater than the sentiment..."

Suddenly implicated, his heart must have been suffocating with frustration. From beginning to end, he never mentioned Qi Lanyan's name, his tone filled with resentment. He merely lowered his head and whispered,

"Unexpectedly, Yangfeng was bent on seeking death, presumptuously delaying the Bright Yang heavenly might! When the news came back then, everyone in my prefecture gritted their teeth, hating him for recklessly misleading others. I beg... King Wei to see that the Qi clan was not deeply involved and show mercy in all ways... Lanjin is willing to leave his body to your disposal in exchange for the stability of a city!"

He finished this sentence and spoke no more, waiting quietly. But the person above stared at him calmly for a long time before finally saying indifferently.

"This King does not harm the public for private reasons."

These words landed in the great hall, resounding and forceful, instantly dissolving the tense atmosphere. The Daoist Master kneeling in the hall also felt a heavy burden lifted, only to hear King Wei continue,

"Furthermore, I have never held a grudge against him. Fellow Daoist Yangfeng... can be considered a decisive and heroic talent. If not for his fall, the lands of Xiang and Gu might not have seen these several battles today."

The great hall fell silent for a moment. Qi Lanjin was somewhat in disbelief, and the various Divine Ability cultivators were mostly surprised. Only Yu Xixin stroked his beard and nodded very slightly.

The name Qi Lanyan resounded through the north and south, yet whether in the south or north, the reputation of this name was not good. Many Daoist Traditions in the south had been harmed by his warmongering; whether it was the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition or the Great Song, their losses were not small, so they naturally hated him considerably.

And in the north, this Daoist Master who once controlled Jianghuai and contained Yang clan and the Great Song received no praise either. The northern Purple Mansion cultivators under his command hated him for making a fuss over minor issues and oppressing them too severely, while the Buddhist cultivators called south did not gain much benefit, making excuses and pushing the blame onto his head.

And the most critical were those two routs: Vast Cicada fell, causing the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Tao clan to break with him; the Battle of Salt Lake harmed the Helian clan and the Lord of the Tiefu Kingdom; and this Daoist Master Yangfeng even staked his own life at that small inlet lake.

But no matter what, this person had once brought Li Zhouwei considerable trouble. When Qi Lanyan was around, he had inflicted heavy injuries on Li Zhouwei at least several times, shaking Moongaze Lake!

Li Zhouwei's words were not exaggerated. If Qi Lanyan had not fallen, he would certainly have been able to integrate the people of Luo, and he would never have allowed such a breach to fall into Li Zhouwei's hands!

'He could have at least blocked me until I achieved the status of Great Daoist Master.'

By comparison, the Qi Lanjin before him was clearly a notch lower. He carried the air of a Chun City cultivator living in comfort and discussing the Dao with leisure. Although he could achieve the Purple Mansion Realm and his Dao-heart was surely steadfast as a mountain, he ultimately could not compare to Qi Lanyan.

"Lanjin is willing to die for King Wei!"

Qi Lanjin did not care about these things. He simply let out a sigh of relief, stood up, raised his head, and bowed to withdraw. Qiao Wenliu had waited anxiously for this while and could endure it no longer. He stepped forward and whispered,

"We have already wasted much time here. Now that we have finally conquered it, we should make plans quickly!"

He considered.

"By now... the Chun City side must have long received the news. Before long, someone is bound to come..."

Yu Xixin, who had been listening quietly all along, suddenly said,

"Even if people come... it is impossible for them to retake High-Peak City."

These words made the various Divine Ability cultivators nod in unison. Even Li Zhouwei's group had gone all out and taken two hours to capture this place. Now, guarding the city with the advantage of defense, and with Yu Xixin having surrendered, how much manpower would Chun City need to spend to take it back?

Qiao Wenliu, however, said coldly, "I fear... Longkang Yao is nowhere to be seen because he went to Juan City long ago!"

Clearly, this Daoist Master Qiao’s worry was not without cause. Li Zhouwei had left Juan City, leaving Li Jiangqian and others to guard it. If Longkang Yao had indeed pulled the firewood from under the cauldron and gone to encircle it, this Daoist Master Qiao’s lair might not last long!

Before the group could speak, they saw King Wei raise his eyebrows. Immediately following, the various Divine Ability cultivators all sensed something. They raised their heads together, gazing toward the south.

They saw firelight faintly in the southern sky, like a Fire God in fury. Rolling black qi was intermingled within it, seemingly containing infinite killing intent. Even though there were only small patches of red and black on the horizon, they could not escape the eyes of the Divine Ability cultivators!

Li Zhouwei suddenly rose, gazing for a long time, hearing Qiao Wenliu wonder,

"It is... Mount Rao!"

Mount Rao was the southern gateway of Gu Prefecture and also the place where Longkang Yao was originally stationed. When Li Zhouwei set out from Juan City back then, he had bypassed Mount Rao to take the eastern gateway, Mount Jiao, directly capturing Wen Daoping!

Longkang Yao was thus forced to come out from Mount Rao, chasing first east and then north, leading to the great battle at Chefu. Li Zhouwei had now conquered the northern gateway, but he had not expected a fire to start in the rear of Gu Prefecture...

He stared at the south, watching the endlessly entangled black and red colors. Wu Miao was slightly surprised.

"Blazing Fire! It is Longkang Yao! He... returned to Mount Rao!"

"No wonder!"

The Divine Ability cultivators were stunned in unison. Yu Xixin gritted his teeth, the confusion in his heart finally clearing up completely.

"No wonder... No wonder I defended for a full two hours, yet saw not a single trace of anyone..."

Li Zhouwei knew that Longkang Yao had gone all the way south. Otherwise, he would not have boldly come to attack High-Peak City. But only now did he understand why it was so. His brows furrowed tightly.

"Black qi... is it Exiled Qi? Yang Ruiyi?"

"How is that possible..."

Indeed, this Great General of the Great Song had the ability to pin down Longkang Yao. Being stationed in the south and occupying quite a few Lotus Temple territories, he was also in a position to reach Mount Rao most quickly...

But reasonably speaking, Yang Ruiyi had already reached a tacit understanding with him. The Yang clan would no longer offend the northern families, merely maintaining a retreat route for him; they would absolutely not rashly stick their necks out for Li Zhouwei!

But Yu Xixin and the others beside him were completely unaware of the inside story and sighed with great emotion. Qiao Wenliu stepped forward in joy,

"So it is General Yang! King Wei... we can attack... Chun City!"

Li Zhouwei’s eyes also lit up—regardless of what had happened in the south, with one Great Daoist Master defecting and another Great Daoist Master distracted, this was an extremely precious opportunity for war!

But meeting Qiao Wenliu's bright gaze, Li Zhouwei instead slowly turned his head and cast his gaze toward the west.

He had set out from Juan City, going first south, then east, then north, meaning he had already circled this Gu Prefecture. Departing from High-Peak City now and heading southwest, breaking through several territories, would lead back to where he came from—Juan City, guarded by Li Jiangqian and the others!

'My forces are insufficient. Looting their territory is not as good as striking their vitals! Rather than penetrating deep into Chun City and provoking the various families, it is better to take this Great Daoist Master... and go straight to the Yun and Pu passes outside Juan City...'

He stood up without hesitation. Even though his heart missed that fragment dearly, he still abandoned the seemingly tempting choice of penetrating Chun City. Even High-Peak City, this pass he had exhausted untold hardships to obtain, seemed insignificant now.

If they could coordinate from inside and outside to smash the two passes, then Chun City would lose its defenses on all four sides, and the initiative to advance or retreat would be entirely his!

He did not even have the leisure to investigate this famous city where Emperor Zhao had fallen. Without stopping for a moment, his gaze swept over everyone, and he commanded,

"Daoist Master Yuanbian!"

Liu Changdie immediately bowed, looking at him with burning eyes. Under the gaze of the crowd, Li Zhouwei decided decisively,

"You defend this city alone, await orders, and be ready to abandon the city and leave at any time. Yu Xixin, Qiao Wenliu, lead your respective forces and follow me out of the city... We gallop west to break the siege!"
