# Chapter 1300: Judgement Prison

The Great Tomb River had been open for some time and rain began to patter down between heaven and earth, but the river's surface was too turbulent, like cast refined iron, preventing even the slightest ripple from forming.

_Rumble!_

Yu Xi escaped from Chiguang's grasp with his life, fleeing desperately to the east, and only stopped after a long while, discovering that the watery region ahead was filled with rumbling thunder, the intense purple light so strong that he could see it clearly even from such a great distance!

'What treasure... or is it a lightning cultivator... does the mainland have such a powerful lightning cultivator? This person must be at the Great Daoist Master cultivation level!'

His heart was filled with doubt, yet also tinged with a measure of luck.Regardless, Chiguang currently lacked the energy to pursue him. Only then did he slow his pace, only to realize he was flying higher and higher, already approaching the river's surface.

The clouds on the horizon churned, streaks of Profound Yellow Qi interweaving. It seemed to be an extremely beautiful phenomenon, yet it gave Yu Xi, who was continuously moving through the water, a flicker of doubt.

'Profound Qi... a divine ability has fallen...'

There are only a few families in the world possessing Profound Qi. Who else could it be?

'The Touba...'

Yu Xi suddenly grew uneasy.

'It's actually the Touba... could it be Touba Ci?'

Yu Xi was also a northern cultivator and was extremely familiar with the strength of these individuals. Although Touba Ci was only a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with three divine abilities, as a direct descendant of the Touba family, he possessed all sorts of trump cards. Even a Great Daoist Master would need considerable effort to force him into a desperate situation, to say nothing of the river's obstruction within this grotto-heaven!

'Why would someone offend the Touba family!'

As he rapidly sank toward the riverbed, his heart grew heavy. In the world today, the people who could kill a Touba—and specifically had to kill Touba Ci—were none other than those select few, and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of their stature were few and far between, making it all too easy to guess.

'Could it be that Dongfang Heyun has entered...'

Yu Xi found it hard to believe. Yet regardless, this was the only answer that fit, causing his expression to immediately darken.

'The grotto-heavens in the world are numbered, especially on the mainland; whether they are opening or falling, there is always a matter of great powers to consider, so how could there be any reason to allow Dongfang Heyun to enter!'

This was an extremely unusual matter. The Great Tomb River was an ancient grotto-heaven of proper origins, right under the noses of the northern Daoist traditions, not deep in the Eastern Sea. Back then, even the Dragon-kin hadn't dared to meddle with the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven that opened near the coast, let alone the Great Tomb River!

Furthermore, Dongfang Heyun was an embodiment of the Dragon Monarch's authority, here to execute the True Monarch's will. This was the mainland!

'When did the Dragon-kin's reach extend so far?'

'He shouldn't have the qualifications or the opportunity to enter this place, and his significance far exceeds that of a mere Dragon Prince; he practically represents the Dragon Monarch's dominion over this location, so what kind of joke is this!'

This bizarre situation caused his brow to darken, and he faintly felt a chill run down his spine. After staying beneath the water's surface for a while, he finally understood where this strange feeling was coming from.

'The water level is getting higher and higher!'

'It's rising unusually high!'

If the great river before him was calm yet swift when he first entered this place, there was now an extremely strange difference in elevation. The water level to the east was clearly higher than before!

And in the direction he had just come from—the west, where Chiguang and the others were—the water level was also rising at a terrifying speed after the lightning had subsided, and he could feel distinctly powerful waves...

'This is far from ordinary...'

Having cultivated the Dao for so many years, Yu Xi still had some ability to predict a crisis. Even though divine abilities were running rampant here and most divination and sensing arts were ineffective, the uneasiness in his heart was real, but with the grotto-heaven currently stable and no path to the outside, he could only swim deeper, and after an unknown amount of time, he unexpectedly saw another palace complex.

An intense azure light was blooming ahead, forcing him to stop cautiously. Instead, he heard laughter from within the waves,

"Two Daoist friends, why bother struggling?! Just hand over the Three Uprights Spring Chariot already."

He saw a distant glimmer in the water bloom with myriad points of Buddhist light. Yet a lone figure stood faintly within, their dark body seeming to connect heaven and earth, holding a profound vessel, while an intense power suppressed the river water, nearly solidifying the surroundings.

Standing within the light was a man in azure robes, his expression ugly. Yu Xi actually recognized him. It was Daoist Master Qinghu from the south, whose surname was Sima.

Sima Yuanli held a gourd in one hand and a profound stone in the other. This stone was strange, to say the least, for though only the size of a palm, it was carved with countless lofty mountains and high ranges, upon which a long river flowed, winding and twisting, its head and tail connected, stretching on endlessly!

A dim, gray light shone from it, protecting the azure-robed man completely. It also enveloped the woman behind him, allowing them to stand calmly within the layers of overlapping Buddhist light.

Yu Xi was not familiar with him and didn't think much of the man. But the female Daoist Master behind him immediately caught his attention. This person was wreathed in the rolling radiance of Horn Wood, had a delicate and pretty face, and was, in fact, an old acquaintance!

'Yang Xuancai!'

As Yu Xi observed from afar, the monk attacked fiercely, all kinds of dark light pouring down and smashing into the gray radiance, yet it only stirred up small waves, making the monk's gaze grow even more astonished and carry a hint of greed.

"The Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges truly is formidable!"

Yu Xi's expression suddenly flickered.

'The Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges!'

Back then, the Song Emperor had sent Sima Yuanli to the Salt Lake to support Li Zhouwei, and after he presented the Huai River Map, the emperor had specially taken this very item—the Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges—as compensation. The cultivators of Jiangnan might not know its reputation, but the cultivators of the north knew it crystal clear!

'This item was originally a treasure of the Heavenly Lang Terrace and was extremely famous. Back then, King Yong, Guo Wusi, relied on this item to build a mighty reputation, so it was passed down into the Yang family's hands...'

Sima Yuanli and Yang Xuancai, two cultivators with only one divine ability each, were able to last so long against Xiaodisa. It was precisely because they were relying on this Spiritual Treasure!

With this realization, Yu Xi's mind instantly started scheming.

'This Qinghu claims to have been on good terms with the Li family for generations, and they are even related by marriage. He is also heavily favored in the Great Song, so if I can use this opportunity to exchange a life-saving favor for a personal debt, it will surely be of great use!'

'Perfect, the one surnamed Yang is here too!'

Yang Xuancai's presence did not give Yu Xi the slightest inclination to harm her. On the contrary, his desire to help grew even stronger.

'This woman is soft-hearted and lacks any ruthless methods; the incident back then was, to put it bluntly, just a matter of instigation, and since my family has already rendered great service to the new dynasty, there's no need to harm her again, lest I be discovered by Martial Cultivation methods. It is better to resolve enmity than to create it, so I should take this opportunity to clear the air.'

He deliberately suppressed his divine ability and concealed his figure, preparing to wait for the critical moment.

But while he was at ease, his calculations running smoothly, Sima Yuanli, who stood beneath the Buddhist light, already felt a chill crawl down his spine. He pondered for a long time, his heart extremely uneasy.

'This is taking too long...'

After parting ways with Li Jiangqian, Sima Yuanli had pressed onward. He couldn't understand why Dongfang Heyun would appear in this place, yet he also felt Li Jiangqian wouldn't deceive him without reason, which made him increasingly cautious.

Perhaps he simply lacked fortunate destiny when it came to grotto-heavens. Back then in Wanling Heaven, he had been robbed clean by Chi Buzi, and now, in this grotto-heaven, there was no Chi Buzi, yet he repeatedly came up empty, one step slow, every step slow, having really not managed to find anything good.

He had rare luck bumping into Yang Xuancai, but he hadn't expected this woman surnamed Yang to actually have some skill. In another territory, she had run into the Merciful One, snatched away their Three Uprights Spring Chariot, and fled all the way here!

Sima Yuanli coveted her Upright Wood treasure, and Yang Xuancai knew she had already been detected by the Buddhist cultivators and couldn't protect it alone. Since both of them were weak and isolated, they had immediately teamed up, but being outmaneuvered and trapped here by Xiaodisa was bad enough, he had then learned another extremely shocking piece of news from Yang Xuancai.

"Below us is the Judgement Prison?"

He asked with lingering disbelief, even as he pushed the Spiritual Treasure with all his might. Behind him, Yang Xuancai was gritting her teeth and using a divine ability to heal the wound on her forearm, and said,

"Yes!"

Seeing Sima Yuanli still wore a look of disbelief, she had no choice but to add,

"I have been deep below. There is an Earth Abyss down there with a stone tablet erected, and it's called the Judgement Prison!"

Sima Yuanli's heart sank into despair.

He had seen those two monks fighting. Without a doubt, their destination was this very Judgement Prison!

'Either they are on their way, or they are in the Earth Abyss right now. If this drags on, all the Buddhist cultivators will soon arrive, perhaps even Tian Langzhi!'

The two of them, Sima Yuanli included, could only bitterly hold on against Xiaodisa by relying on the Spiritual Treasure; how could they possibly face Tian Langzhi, a Maha Liangli of the Way of Great Desire?

'But this Xiaodisa right in front of us is impossible to deal with...'

With every moment they waited, their hope of escaping alive dwindled. Hesitation gradually appeared in the azure-robed Daoist Master's eyes. He turned to Yang Xuancai, seeming to want to speak but holding back.

As a cultivator who possessed a divine ability, how could Yang Xuancai not know what he was thinking? She was terrified and cried out,

"Fellow Daoist, don't be rash! How could he only want the Three Uprights Spring Chariot? What he truly covets is the Profound Water Stone of the Far Ridges!"

But Sima Yuanli shook his head and said through gritted teeth,

"How could I be so foolish! What I mean is... we've reached a dead end; we can't afford to be reluctant any longer!"

Even though his eyes betrayed his extreme reluctance, he could only speak with resolve,

"The Three Uprights Spring Chariot... give it to him!"

Yang Xuancai gritted her teeth.

"I'm willing to give it, but if I hand it over, will that truly be the end of it?"

Sima Yuanli shook his head grimly.

"Let me try."

Yang Xuancai raised her hand to her sleeve, falling silent for a moment.

If she gave it to Sima Yuanli, and he used some treasure to escape first, abandoning her here, wouldn't she lose both her wealth and her life!

"Pfft!"

Outside, the mountain-sized profound vessel smashed down. Even after its power was weakened by the Spiritual Treasure's layers of defense, Sima Yuanli still spat out a mouthful of blood. He froze for a moment, his first reaction a bitter smile.

Back then, during the battle on the northern shore, he, Sima Yuanli, had been even more suspicious than Yang Xuancai was now, causing Li Zhouwei to miss the opportunity and allowing Taixi to escape. At this moment, he couldn't even muster any anger, and simply said,

"If I were to take both treasures and flee, Xiaodisa would certainly chase me, allowing you to escape. I am not that kind-hearted!"

Although Yang Xuancai didn't fully believe him, she also understood that time was of the essence. She finally took a small, exquisite carriage from her sleeve. It was a vibrant, shimmering azure, with a single pale-green shaft, and at its center sat a tiny, kneeling charioteer figurine, all rendered in exquisite detail.

Sima Yuanli took it directly and inspected it for a moment, breathing a sigh of relief. He brought two fingers together, touched the spot between his brows, and formed an incantation seal. Then, with a pained expression, he took a talisman from his robes, gently stuck it onto the carriage, and gripped it.

"Go!"

Although the carriage didn't manifest its true form, it seemed to come alive in an instant, transforming into a streak of light and speeding away. Sima Yuanli, meanwhile, formed a seal with both hands, pressed them onto the profound stone, and commanded,

"Go!"

In an instant, the Pit Water stirred violently; the Spiritual Treasure resonated with the extremely dense Pit Water qi in the surrounding world, transforming the two of them into a splendid, profound streak of Pit Water light that sped away in a completely different direction.

But the Buddhist cultivator before them simply laughed.

"Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!"

He completely ignored the departing Three Uprights Spring Chariot. His body swelled rapidly, transforming into a pitch-black radiance that spanned the heavens, and he was clearly using his full strength. His two hands, like mountain peaks, moved to clamp the Pit Water light between them, slamming together with the force to topple mountains and overturn seas!

A sharp light flashed in Sima Yuanli's eyes. One hand channeled his divine ability, while the other was already raised to his lips, pinching a bright, glistening yellow profound talisman whose spiritual light was so brilliant it seemed to captivate the soul.

'The Yellow Dao Profound Talisman!'

The supreme treasure that Daoist Master Yuanxiu, Si Boxiu, had spent his entire life refining and passed down!

Sima Yuanli had experienced all kinds of perilous situations but had never once used it. Now, he had finally taken out this ultimate trump card. Resonating with the talisman, he shouted:

"I beseech the Yellow Dao, escape through the Profound Gate!"

The streak of Pit Water light abruptly vanished, replaced by the shimmering azure Three Uprights Spring Chariot. Sima Yuanli, meanwhile, had taken the Chariot's original position and was now escaping at extreme speed!

'Incredible!'

This maneuver not only caught Xiaodisa off guard, but even Yu Xi, who had been about to make his move, was stunned. Yang Xuancai, having survived the calamity, focused all her power on mystically sustaining the Spiritual Treasure, but Sima Yuanli's face held not the slightest trace of a smile. It was deathly pale, his eyes filled with hatred:

'A pity... such a pity. Such a perfect casting medium... snatched away by him just like that...'

The feedback from the profound talisman quickly caused his expression to change drastically. In the distance, the astonishment on Xiaodisa's face lasted only for an instant before he burst into loud laughter.

"Disciple-brother!"

As if rising in response, a heavy, reddish-gold light flooded the water. A massive golden body abruptly emerged, like another profound mountain, ruthlessly pressing down on the two of them.

The Sixth-Generation Dharma Protector Maha of the Way of Great Desire, Renshijia!

Another Sixth-Generation Maha!

Despair finally surfaced in Sima Yuanli's eyes. His grip on the Spiritual Treasure tightened, and from the violent vibrations, he spat out another mouthful of blood, while Xiaodisa's voice, brimming with superiority, echoed out,

"You two are truly lucky, running right into the hands of us disciple-brothers, and you still think you can escape?"

This voice shook the heavens. Xiaodisa was in the north and Renshijia was in the south, sitting opposite one another like two profound mountains in view of each other, trapping the pair to their deaths within that embrace.

An instant of dead silence fell.

Renshijia's gaze seemed to sweep unintentionally over a corner of the water. He sneered,

"No one can save you now! When my brother and I join forces, our power is boundless; even if that White Qilin came, he'd have to spit up blood before leaving, let alone two cultivators with a single divine ability each!"

His disciple-brother's words were loud, causing the smile on Xiaodisa's face—who had personally crossed blows with Li Zhouwei—to stiffen. He gave a dry laugh, finding it difficult to respond.

This disciple-brother of Xiaodisa's was extremely skilled in combat and refused to accept the prowess of that three-divine-ability King Wei, believing it was only because of the mutual interference in the north that the White Qilin had gained the upper hand.

'That is indeed true; if River Chief and I had been able to join forces back then, it definitely wouldn't have been such a disastrous defeat... however... there is no Buddhist Land here, so even if my disciple-brother and I team up, at most we could just suppress him... it's unlikely we'd make him spit blood...'

But soon, it was not just his smile that stiffened, but his entire face.

Renshijia sensed it too. His massive, condescending head suddenly snapped up. Looking north from his vantage point, he saw that at some unknown time, a beam of light had appeared behind his disciple-brother's golden body.

This beam of light was incredibly strange. It seemed to be shining from within the river, its perfectly round, brilliant source resembling a great golden solar disk, and an ink-robed figure stood within it, seeming to be at the edge of the sky, yet simultaneously right before them.

The light stung his eyes, a dignified Sixth-Generation Maha, and with the heavy river water obstructing his senses, he actually couldn't distinguish the newcomer's aura. He could only see the shocked expression on his disciple-brother Xiaodisa's face as his golden lips moved,

'The White Qilin!'

"The White Qilin?"

Renshijia's heart leaped at the sight of new prey.

"We will certainly make him meet his end here!"
