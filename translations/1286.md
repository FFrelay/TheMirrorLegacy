# Chapter 1286: Guidance

The two advanced with a tacit understanding, quickly crossing the great river to behold the premier lake of the south, its glittering waves a vision of countless splendors. Qiao Yue gazed deeply at it, unable to stop himself from sighing.

Ju Liangwang, however, asked,

"Daoist Friend Qiao, what is there to sigh about?"

"Leaving our homes behind..."

Qiao Yue answered faintly, but Ju Liangwang just chuckled.

"I, on the other hand, envy your Qiao clan, yet even you are sighing. When King Wei pacified Xiangyang, my Ju clan had no mystic realms to offer, nor any divine abilities to contribute. Our foundation of several hundred years was solely at Mount Liangchuan; since my Ju clan could not defend it, it all became Daoist Master Jia's achievement."

"Now we are relocated to Jianghuai, with no support to rely on. I am not a man talented enough to attain the Dao, and my age is already advanced. If Mount Liangchuan faces calamity and my clan brother perishes during his breakthrough, then amidst the shifting tides of the world, my Ju clan will be nothing more than an ant!"

This Daoist of the Ju clan seemed to think the opposite of many from the Qiao family; he did not fear losing wealth, he feared having no wealth _to_ lose!

His gaze was calm as he stared at Qiao Yue. The younger man was startled at first, then silently offered comfort.

"At least... there is still the Yu clan!"

The Ju and Yu families were joined by marriage; Ju Liangwang was Yu Xi's grandson-in-law and should have received some consideration, yet he shook his head.

"My wife died young and childless, and moreover... that old Daoist Master..."

'Old Daoist Master Yu's own lifespan is nearly at its end, and he has no successor. How could he possibly look after my Ju clan!'

The two finally stopped speaking, each bringing two attendants as they crossed the surging river to the lake. Before they had even traveled a few miles, someone moved to intercept them, an extremely young man who cupped his fist in salute and said with a smile,

"Daoist Friends... you are now in the territory of Ting Province!"

Although the person before them seemed to have only just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Qiao Yue also hurriedly returned the salute.

"Greetings, Daoist Friend. I am Qiao Yue, a cultivator of the Qiao clan, and this is Daoist Friend Ju. We were originally a noble family from Luoxia, newly relocated to Jianghuai, and we have come to express our gratitude!"

Ju Liangwang did not say much. The youth's eyes were bright as he smiled.

"So you are esteemed cultivators from the north. I am Pu Xinya of the Pu clan, and I humbly hold a post in the province. You are both too polite. Please, follow me."

'A noble family from the lake...'

The two discerned his origins and exchanged a glance.

To put it bluntly, if not for King Wei, people like Pu Xinya would, upon arriving in Luoxia, be shown disdain by any direct descendant of their two families and ordered around at will; they would be utterly unqualified to stand straight-backed before them.

'Status rises and falls in but a single night.'

The two said little, maintaining their polite demeanor as they headed toward the provincial center. They saw it was extremely lively all around, with many people reporting good news. Ju Liangwang smiled.

"We've come at a fortunate time; there is a joyous event on the lake."

At the mention of this, Pu Xinya's mood brightened considerably. He bowed toward the south out of respect before smiling.

"King Wei is divinely mighty, and the Daoist Master's methods are wondrous! They have established a great karmic affinity for our eastern bank, using a supreme treasure to establish a divine, blessed land. That mountain is now a vision of countless phenomena, fragrant with spiritual activity everywhere..."

"It has even caused the spiritual activity of the entire eastern bank to recover. My Pu family, the Chi family, and all the other families of the eastern bank have received immense benefits. The fire veins in our clans are surging, and our cultivation grounds have been greatly enhanced!"

He was beaming with delight—the Li clan's goal was merely to elevate Milin Mountain for pill refinement and Purple Mansion Realm cultivation, yet the small benefits that trickled down from their efforts were enough to make the families of the eastern bank ecstatic and wealthy.

Ju Liangwang heard this and stroked his beard, privately puzzled.

'A few days ago, it was said... there were signs in Ting Province of a Molten Fire divine ability perishing. This must be the incident... the secret of that hall.'

The two offered their congratulations, and Pu Xinya led them inside to the main hall. He went to report their arrival and quickly returned with a reply, turning to them with a smile.

"What a coincidence, His Highness has just finished handling matters for the eastern bank. Please, this way!"

Hearing the title 'His Highness,' Ju Liangwang's heart finally turned solemn.

'A golden-eyed direct descendant of the Bright Yang Li clan!'

'A pure-blooded descendant of a Golden Core!'

Ju Liangwang followed the attendant forward, entering through the main gates.

A dazzling radiance from within the great hall washed over him. The interior was extremely spacious, with twelve pillars standing tall. Atop nine levels of golden steps was the main throne, before which a handsome man was seated.

Strangely, this Highness seemed to have already concluded his affairs and appeared quite casual. He was not sitting on the main throne, but rather on the third golden step, holding a jade slip and pondering with his gaze lowered.

The main throne, flickering with heavenly light, seemed to prostrate behind him, like a beast hidden in the background.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

The young man raised his head. His golden pupils were not fierce, his expression even gentle, yet it caused the two men, who had once looked up at King Wei, to feel a surge of alarm. They instantly lowered their heads, their hearts trembling.

"Both Family Heads, please rise!"

The young man amicably bade them rise before speaking.

"Have both of your families arrived in Jianghuai?"

Qiao Yue hurriedly replied,

"We are not like other families and travel lighter. Our cultivators have come ahead first, and two batches of mortals have already been transported. Grateful for the rescue by King Wei and Daoist Master Qing Feng, we came immediately to pay our respects."

The Qiao clan's ancestors had been supporters of the Cui clan, and Qiao Yue himself had exchanged a few words with Cui Jueyin back in the day. Perhaps it was old sentiment, or perhaps that long-ago question—"Are you descendants of High Radiance?"—had taken effect. In just these few sentences, he had already sensed this Daoist Master's goodwill toward himself and his family.

'My family holds so many spiritual resources, yet unlike the Wei or Ju clans, we have no cultivator in seclusion about to reach the Purple Mansion Realm... If we cannot obtain the protection of a Purple Mansion cultivator, we will certainly lose a portion today, forfeit a portion tomorrow, and be eaten away day by day!'

Qiao Yue desperately wanted to grasp any life-saving straw, so he naturally couldn't pass up the chance, intentionally mentioning Cui Jueyin. The young man before him, however, sighed.

"Lighter? You have been wronged, Family Head Qiao."

Qiao Yue was startled at first, then immediately grew hesitant and uneasy. But Li Suihuan changed the subject, chatting with them about the situation in the north. Understanding dawned in his heart, and he said softly,

"My grandfather pacified Xiangyang, and everyone contributed greatly. Daoist Master Cui has also mentioned you, Family Head; both the Qiao and Wei surnames once served under High Radiance. You are old vassals."

Qiao Yue quickly bowed, his heart leaping with excitement, and just as he expected, he heard His Highness say,

"Daoist Master Cui is on the mountain right now. You should go and pay your respects to him!"

"Many thanks, Your Highness, for granting this opportunity!"

Qiao Yue's eyes immediately reddened.

He understood the current situation all too well. For his Qiao clan to establish a foothold in Jianghuai seemed to present countless difficulties, but in reality, it required only a single word from the Li family!

It didn't even require a direct descendant of the Li clan; as long as this Daoist Master Cui was willing to ask after them and show a shred of concern, it would be enough to protect his entire clan, old and young!

He bowed once more before rising and hastily retreating. Ju Liangwang had been waiting patiently to the side. Only after Qiao Yue had disappeared from view did this Daoist step forward, salute, and bow.

"This Ju has come to the lake with an item to offer Your Highness!"

Li Suihuan turned, his golden eyes sweeping over him.

"Family Head Ju, what is this...?"

Ju Liangwang shuffled forward, raised both hands, and revealed the object in his palms—it was a pale golden jade slip!

The middle-aged man bowed.

"My Ju clan's foundation is shallow, but we have no Dao-method restrictions. Our ancestors cultivated the Dao of Thunder and the Body of Kui. Later, the Body of Kui qi was severed, so we supplemented it with the Daos of Metal and Water. Today... I offer it to the lake!"

His expression was resolute as he spoke in a low voice.

"Herein are the fundamental methods: Revolving Purple of the Celestial Thunder Dao; Rhythm of Enacting Might and Smiting the Sealed Altar of the Profound Thunder Dao; and the Palace of Retracted Killing and Heavy Murk, which we have acquired over hundreds of years!"

This Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator had impassively traveled south and was now offering up the Ju clan's entire inheritance!

These were a full five Purple Mansion Realm divine ability inheritances. The two Metal and Water divine abilities were already precious enough, but even rarer were the three thunder-based arts—exceedingly few in this day and age!

Such a precious gift revealed Ju Liangwang's decisiveness. Li Suihuan was silent for a long time before he spoke.

"What do you want, Daoist Friend Ju?"

Ju Liangwang's gaze was bright as he replied.

"Guidance from the Immortal Clan."

Li Suihuan frowned.

"Guidance?"

Ju Liangwang spoke softly.

"I have heard that your noble clan has a Jade Palace in Milin that oversees all cultivation on the eastern bank. The Ju clan has long admired Bright Yang. Our homeland was remote, and we lack the ability to support our descendants. We only hope that there is a place of cultivation on the immortal mountain, to allow the descendants of my Ju clan to study immortal arts and build their immortal foundations."

Li Suihuan's gaze shifted slightly, and he looked at him with appreciation. Ju Liangwang continued softly.

"My clan came south rashly. Many of our spirit roots were interconnected with our great formations and were all left behind in our old lands, leaving us with no means of livelihood. However, Mount Liangchuan was connected to the lands of Jin, and for hundreds of years, cultivators have traveled back and forth, staying to cultivate in our market city... My clan's disciples know a bit about commerce. We hope to trade for entry into the Milin market, to make a living trading far and wide."

Li Suihuan stood up, descended the steps, and asked softly.

"Is that all?"

"That is all!"

This Daoist of the Ju clan, his expression unchanged, prostrated on the ground.

"We only hope Your Highness will grant our request!"

...

Cui Jueyin led the man east from the lake. When they arrived at the great mountain, he couldn't help but stop and gaze, his face filled with amazement.

He, Cui Jueyin, had dutifully served in Milin for decades back when he was in the Foundation Establishment Realm and was intimately familiar with every peak and stone. What lay before him now was no longer the Milin Mountains he remembered.

The mountain's contours had changed considerably, its peaks now several dozen _zhang_ higher. Most of the vegetation had receded, exposing a crimson-red surface. The remaining thirty percent that survived had also changed color, showing patches of uneven red.

The spiritual activity of the entire Milin Mountains had more than quadrupled. Several areas' spiritual activity now rivaled Gardenia Scenery Mountain, and even the relatively sparse areas far surpassed their former state, vaguely comparable to lake province before its formation was established. Even more vigorous were the subterranean fire veins, packed densely together, providing no fewer than thirty locations suitable for drawing fire for artifact and pill refinement.

The gifts bestowed by these three Molten Fire divine abilities, nurtured for a thousand years, were far from limited to this; they had even left behind three wondrous spectacles on the mountain!

One, located at the foot of the mountain, was a stretch of fertile land rich in spiritual activity and suffused with continuous Molten Fire, gathering the nurturing virtue of fire. Although it was nothing special to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, its strength lay in its vastness. The Milin region was already famous for its thousand _li_ of fertile fields, and this ring of rich earth surrounding the mountain could produce a significant amount of spiritual resources.

At a slightly higher elevation, there was an earth-fire. No dark flame rose, but it roamed continuously beneath the ground, emitting the scorching light of Molten Fire. As soon as one drew near, an invisible fire would naturally manifest, suitable for artifact refinement.

Within the Li clan, because of Li Ximing, the Pill Dao was far more advanced than the Daos of formations and artifacts. It was rare to find such an excellent place for artifact refinement, so this area had long since been cordoned off, with several artifact refiners gazing at it eagerly.

And at the very highest peak, the mountain was now covered in red-leafed fig trees, with invisible fire ascending. In the very center, a fire spring was exposed, and an enormous golden pill cauldron stood right in its midst.

A Daoist Master in platinum-gold robes stood before the cauldron, a mark of Heavenly Light on his brow. He stood with a casual grace, two fingers held together, seemingly sensing the Celestial Yang.

"Lord!"

Cui Jueyin bowed, and the Daoist Master turned, nodding with a smile. Qiao Yue secretly raised an eyebrow, finding this Daoist Master Zhaojing's smile to be truly peaceful and extremely amiable.

He did not dare to look closely, but Li Ximing was observing him in turn. He didn't speak to Qiao Yue, only to Cui Jueyin.

"Jueyin, you've come!"

Cui Jueyin bowed.

"Congratulations, my Lord!"

Li Ximing rose, looking very pleased, and gestured to the fire vein behind him in praise.

"It's all thanks to Kuang Hong. He cultivates Assistance in Usurpation and is well-versed in the changes of spiritual activity and the Great Void. When the Molten Fire divine abilities fell, he buried two spiritual resources to guide the fire vein. Then, upon reaching the peak, he used the Cultivation Transcendence divine ability's characteristic of connecting Yin to ferry Yang to draw it out... Only then did we get this Spring of Still-Bursting Flame!"

"This spring's purpose is to accumulate Molten Fire, gathering it to burst forth with the intent of transforming into Blazing Fire. It is primarily composed of nurturing Molten Fire, rarely mixed with the flowing, transformative Blazing Fire."

He smiled.

"Refining pills here not only greatly benefits the spirit pills, but it also speeds up the refinement process. It's even more potent than my Gardenia Scenery Mountain!"

A Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough often transforms a location, having the divine effect of 'dotting the dragon's eyes.' Gardenia Scenery Mountain's foundation was already deep, so when Li Ximing broke through, it became sufficient to support Purple Mansion cultivation. When Li Que'wan broke through at Nine Mounds, the spiritual activity there was even denser, instantly creating a new peak where Cinnabar flowed like waterfalls and metal and stone shifted, forming all sorts of vivid, lifelike shapes.

Because of this, Nine Mounds changed the peak's name—it was originally called Crooked Stone Peak but later became Profound Accomplishment Peak.

As for Zongquan Island where Li Zhouwei broke through, its foundation was too poor; even though the spiritual activity surged due to his breakthrough, allowing descendants to cultivate, it was insufficient to support a Purple Mansion cultivator. Li Jiangqian's anomaly was suppressed, merely resulting in the creation of a single cave dwelling.

The spiritual activity on Milin's peak was a tier lower than Mount Wu's had been, but it benefited from three divine abilities that had been nurtured for a thousand years. Li Ximing looked extremely satisfied. Hearing his words, Cui Jueyin smiled.

"That's not all. Senior Liu's skill in the Dao of formations is astounding. Once things in Luoxia are more stable and he has a chance to slip away, he can come here. With his Dao-Profundity, he won't even need to lay down a grand Purple Mansion great formation; just one or two clever designs will surely be enough to raise it by several tenths more."

Li Ximing nodded, his gaze already landing on the man kneeling on the steps behind him. Cui Jueyin immediately understood.

"My Lord, your Pill Dao is supreme and your name is renowned throughout Jiangnan, yet you have few to carry on your legacy. This junior happened to meet a malleable talent in Luoxia and has brought him for you to see."

His words were not spoken privately, falling directly into Qiao Yue's ears. As the Daoist knelt on the steps, how could he fail to understand—this 'malleable talent' was clearly him, Qiao Yue!

'Becoming a disciple!'

A bolt of profound thunder seemed to explode in the Daoist's mind.

Whether it was Ju Liangwang or himself, they had come to pay their respects and seek protection. Qiao Yue's fervent hope was just to get a bit more notice from Cui Jueyin; he didn't even dare dream of currying favor with the Li family, let alone becoming a disciple!

Who was this Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing?

He was the Li clan's first Daoist Master, the grand-uncle of the current King Wei, a figure of stabilizing, senior-most status in the Li clan! He acted with a low profile, yet his pill arts were unrivaled in Jiangnan, and he thus held deep friendships with the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of many great families.

His direct disciple would be on equal footing with that Bright Yang scion back in the hall. It would be no exaggeration to say they could walk uncontested through all of Jianghuai!
