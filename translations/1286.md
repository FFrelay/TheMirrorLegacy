# Chapter 1286: Yin Shade

His voice resounded in the darkness, scattering the snow-filled sky, as if threatening to summon thunderous downpours and endless oceans, yet it was swallowed piece by piece by the spinning black light.

"It should be so!"

But the old man's gaze was blazing, growing ever brighter.

"The Pit Water of that year was the Hornless Dragon pearl fought over by all the dragons; whoever possessed the virtue to merge and advance it would become the Dragon Monarch, and only after all the dragons had fought and killed one another did that Dragon Monarch finally emerge!"

"This is also why Pit Water is called the Jiazi Pit Water of a Thousand Reticences!"

His body flickered with light, his eyes brimming with comprehension:

"Jiazi, Jiazi... this 'Jiazi' first means completion; second... the 'Jia' refers to the first to emerge from a group, and the 'Zi' that follows it actually represents the nine sons of the True Hornless Dragon!"

"The so-called 'Jiazi' means the 'Son First Among the Group,' the Head of the Nine Sons! It is Dongfang Rijiu! He orchestrated the Orthodox Position Seizing the Abyss and simultaneously destabilized both the Pit Water and the Mansion Water, causing the Pit Water to transform and gain the name 'Jiazi' because of Him!"

"The Head of the Nine Sons pushed the Mansion Water into the Pit Water, creating a convergence; thereafter, all Dragon Monarchs vying for supremacy over the Converging Water had to 'overflow' to supplant Dongfang Rijiu as the 'Jiazi' within the Pit Water—meaning both the First Hornless Dragon Son and the 'Convergence' remaining within the Pit Water!"

At this moment, Xiao Chuting resolved his great confusion regarding the Pit Water's profound name; all his Dao-Profundity linked together, and his divine abilities erupted with the thunderous sound of a waterfall. His voice became unpredictable in the world, as if he had touched upon the seat of some great divine ability, distorting and coalescing into a mass.

If not for the protection of the Exiled Qi, a profound sea of heavenly thunder would have descended at this very moment!

Shock finally appeared in Attendant Yang's gaze; he raised his head, looking at the terrifying scene brewing in the pitch-black world, his yin shade body fluctuating incessantly, affected by this intense clash of spiritual opportunity and Dao.

'He... he just... figured it out from nothing... and he actually dares to say it aloud!'

As the terrifying storm brewed, an endless darkness finally spread forth, like a sea-spanning purple-gold beam, calming all the gales; the heavy snow no longer carried a violent might, only an extreme, silent darkness.

Xiao Chuting seemed to be standing in a void; apart from the small patch of snowy ground beneath his feet, there was nothing else—nothing to see, nothing to touch, and even his spiritual sense perceived only empty blackness.

In the silence, the snow stopped.

Then came the sound of distant footsteps, followed by laughter that gradually grew louder, until, drawing near, a voice was finally heard:

"Impressive."

Xiao Chuting turned slightly; beside him, Attendant Yang had already fallen to his knees, as humble as an ant, and from within the endless darkness, a person slowly walked out.

It was an old man in simple robes; he was advanced in years, but one could still faintly see the mighty appearance of his youth on his face. Xiao Chuting, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, recognized him in an instant:

'Yang Tianya.'

This direct descendant of the Yang family had once 'borrowed the Dao' from the Xiao family; Xiao Chuting, being old, naturally remembered him.

But Xiao Chuting did not believe he was _just_ Yang Tianya.

This 'old friend' did not give Xiao Chuting much time to react, but spoke in a level tone:

"Back then, I heard Judge Jiang say... that you, Xiao Chuting, were a man of talent. I never believed it, but today, I've had my eyes opened."

He said indifferently:

"The matter of seizing the Monarch of the Converging Water is no secret in the eyes of the great ones, but Beijia values his pride and managed to wipe the matter clean. To deduce all this from nothing, relying only on worldly clues and your own Dao-wisdom and Dao-Profundity, enough to expose his past..."

The old man finally broke into a grin:

"You are truly someone."

Xiao Chuting possessed five mighty divine abilities and could even perceive Attendant Yang as a yin shade, yet when facing the person before him, he could see only a void; however, he did not probe further, or perhaps he simply did not care.

He took a step forward and said:

"Your Excellency means to say, this humble cultivator has guessed correctly."

Yang Tianya sat down in the void, and a dark red wooden table and chair materialized beneath him; almost simultaneously, Attendant Yang stepped forward to serve tea, utterly silent and respectful.

Yang Tianya said:

"Sixty percent."

Xiao Chuting fell silent for a moment.

His speculation about the Liang Chu affair back then was not without reason; it was based not only on his own Dao-Profundity and his comprehension of the Pit Water, but also on his judgment of the situation!

Since Liang Chu had experienced a 'Pit Water overflowing' incident back then, it was highly likely that the great ones involved at that time would also interfere in his, Xiao Chuting's, breakthrough this time!

'There is still forty percent...'

The man extended his hand, blew on his tea, and said:

"Xiao Jinzhou... I know of him. Praised to the heavens, called a seed of Dao-attainment. But he is not your equal; no matter how high his Dao-wisdom, it all came to nothing in the end."

Xiao Chuting fixed his gaze on him and bowed:

"To actually receive Your Excellency's praise."

Yang Tianya put down his cup, a trace of genuine regret in his eyes, and said,

"A pity.". He smiled, "What's more... Xiao Chuting, even for a prodigy such as yourself, you will still fail to verify your Dao."

Yang Tianya's gaze shifted from him, casting into the distant darkness.

His tone was cold and decisive, as if stating something that had already occurred.

Xiao Chuting remained unmoved; even though before him was a top-tier yin shade of the Underworld, a great wielder of divine abilities whose single word could determine the life or death of a divine ability and who manipulated all of Jiangnan like a chess game, this 'golden-tongued' judgment still passed by his ear like a light breeze.

He said:

"Since that is the case, Your Excellency's willingness to see me must be to observe the methods of Cangzhou."

Hearing the word "Cangzhou," Yang Tianya revealed a strange smile, his face showing a rare human-like emotion.

It was like mockery, and yet like pity.

He said:

"Not just that."

The judge smiled.

"Since you asked Attendant Yang a question, I must also ask you one in return."

His tone became calm:

"Xiao Chuting, surely you remember the Golden Bridge Lock."

Xiao Chuting lowered his head:

"I remember it well."

Yang Tianya said:

"The Golden Bridge Lock was originally just the golden lock above the Azure Step, sealing the Dao Palace gate before the Profound-Thought Bridge; only after being watched over by many great divine ability wielders did it gradually develop wondrous properties and finally become a Dharma Treasure..."

"When True Monarch Lushui set up the Golden Bridge Lock in the Great Void back then, it was precisely to prevent the Wrath Dharma-image—the Manifestation of the Four Wrathful Demon Emperors—from responding and rescuing Jingzhan; secondly, using the Golden Bridge Lock was also perfectly justifiable."

He smiled:

"After all, the Dao of Wrath is the only one among the Seven Aspects that was formed by an Azure Profoundity cultivator converting to the Buddhists."

"But as it happened, True Monarch Lushui, the Yue Cultivating Sect, and all the other powers were paying attention, throwing the great battle into chaos and causing that person to lose control... and because it was you who spoke out to intervene, all the great houses came to believe it was my Underworld interfering."

The judge's voice was light and airy:

"Today, this venerable one must ask."

"Who gave you the nerve?"

Xiao Chuting stood in the snow, seemingly plunged into endless darkness, yet he was not alarmed.

Since the Yang clan was unwilling to interfere in the Pit Water, they would certainly not move against him, Xiao Chuting; this was merely a test!

Sure enough, seeing him remain silent, Yang Tianya smiled:

"Moongaze Lake."

Xiao Chuting said quietly:

"Your Excellency merely wishes to ask whom I was serving back then; as a Pit Water cultivator, this lowly one's divine ability was weak, I did not understand the greater situation, and I acted on my own authority, using the momentum to draw close to Moongaze Lake..."

Yang Tianya laughed loudly and interrupted:

"Not understand the greater situation? You understood it perfectly! But Daoist Master Xiao, why would Moongaze Lake help you for no reason?"

He gazed into the distance and said softly:

"Although Xuan'an merely borrows another's prestige, he is backed by an Immortal Artifact and is extremely skilled in the wonders of the Supreme Yin, otherwise he could not have deceived the world back then—Concealment is the first rite of the Supreme Yin, so whatever means he used on you, rest assured, it definitely cannot be detected."

"Xiao Chuting, have you ever considered that the so-called 'help' from the lake was merely to collude with the Dragons and scheme for the Bright Yang?"

"I am only afraid they _won't_ collude."

Xiao Chuting's lips moved slightly, but the man before him already understood; he stood up, raised a hand to silence him, and smiled:

"You've been suspicious for a long time."

Judge Yang seemed very interested and said:

"You trust no one and have guessed almost everything; your breakthrough concerns Xuan Cang, the Yue Cultivating Sect, Luoxia, Moongaze Lake..."

Xiao Chuting said quietly:

"And Your Excellency's Underworld."

Judge Yang said:

"Oh?"

The old man pressed down his conical hat and said nonchalantly:

"If my seeking the Dao held no benefit for the Underworld, Lord Yang would not have found it possible to meet me alone."

"There is benefit."

Judge Yang nodded in approval:

"Among all the great houses, only my Underworld has no interest in you; we only wish for you to destroy the Great Ling River. We never interfere in matters of Water-virtue. Now that the greater situation is settled, and I, Yang, have been given sufficient benefits, this venerable one has no need to spoil someone's business. If you have any words of expectation, there is no need to voice them."

A trace of disappointment flashed in Xiao Chuting's eyes.

But the judge before him raised his chin and said quietly:

"But if you can manage to seize all the benefits of the Great Ling River by your own ability, and should you one day fail, it is not certain that I lack the power to protect you."

Xiao Chuting raised an eyebrow at him.

Judge Yang smiled.

"Afterward, you could still enter my Underworld, become a yin shade, and even have the possibility of reincarnating to cultivate anew."

He continued, "There are many in this world who can make such a promise; for them, arranging a cultivator's reincarnation is troublesome in various ways, but for my Underworld, it is the easiest thing of all."

"You could seek the Dao once more, and once more have the chance to ascend to a high position."

Xiao Chuting said hollowly, "What does Your Excellency require?"

Judge Yang stared at him.

"Comply with the Exiled Qi, enter deep into the Underworld, relax your mind, and let the Immortal Artifact examine your True Spirit."

It was not surprising that the Underworld possessed an Immortal Artifact; the Underworld's registry governed all immortals, and quite a few people suspected that object was an Immortal Artifact!

Xiao Chuting stared at him for a long time but did not speak.

'This is aimed at the great one on the lake.'

The old man's thoughts flashed like lightning; in an instant, he had already analyzed the world's greater situation, his heart not wavering in the slightest.

What the lake promised was his, Xiao Chuting's, life-mandate after success; what the Underworld promised was his, Xiao Chuting's, base survival after failure. As one who was seeking the Dao, how could he not distinguish which was superior!

Thus, he remained silent.

The man before him paid him no mind, instead drinking his tea absorbently; after an unknown time, the tea in his cup was finished, and he placed it lightly on the redwood table.

"Daoist Master Xiao, you and I will meet again in the Great Ling River; I hope... that when that time comes, your mind will still be as resolute as iron."

The voice was like a burst of light that illuminated the boundless darkness; radiance filled the world for an instant before it plunged back into thick blackness, but the Daoist Master, who looked like an old fisherman in his straw coat and hat, had already vanished from the snowy ground.

Only the heavy snow continued to fall from the sky.

Attendant Yang, at his side, waited for a long time; realizing that this great one was still staring blankly into the distance, he lowered his head, bowed, and said respectfully:

"Your Excellency... since he will not comply, should we... make any preparations..."

Judge Yang's gaze swept over him as he said,

"He is accumulating momentum."

"Pit Water means great peril; one must kill their way out of that great peril, seeking the Dao without regret or complaint, only then can it be called 'Position Follows Peril'!"

"Besides, it is not certain he won't comply."

A pitch-black light shone in the old man's eyes.

"Right now, he must still rely on Moongaze Lake, so naturally, he cannot show his stance. Wait until he is verifying his Dao at the Great Ling River, sees everyone else take their turn on the stage, and his hopes are shattered; naturally, he will have no one to rely on but us."

"After all, he must believe the words of Xuan Cang, whether he wants to or not."

Attendant Yang pondered for a moment, then said,

"I only fear that someone will not let him go easily."

"Who? Xuan Cang? Or Beijia, who cannot even reach the mainland?"

The old man sneered.

"Even if the Dragon-kin feel a sense of shared danger, they cannot stop me on the mainland; I am determined to seize that Metallic Essence, along with his True Spirit..."

"If it were not for the fact that only one verifying the Dao can resonate with the Immortal Artifact, and that Luoxia would never release Li Zhouwei's True Spirit to us, he, Xiao Chuting, would never have had such an opportunity!"

Attendant Yang hesitated:

"This lowly god only fears... that he did not receive any benefit from Moongaze Lake..."

"The possibility is enough."

Judge Yang said quietly, "This venerable one does not fear trouble, and furthermore, the possibility is not small; that is a True Monarch of the Pit Water, and the one on the lake is already at their wit's end. They cannot possibly let this opportunity go."

He stood up, stepped into the snow, his expression genuinely tinged with regret, and continued,

"If he truly had a chance of verifying his Dao, it would have been an excellent opportunity to test the Wu Light; unfortunately... we can only settle for second best and probe the situation on Moongaze Lake."

Attendant Yang followed with his head perpetually bowed, not saying a word; just as he had finally begun to relax internally, he suddenly heard the old man's ice-cold voice:

"Regarding the matter of moving the capital, how much do you know."

This yin shade had been obsequious and evasive, terrified He would bring this up, but ultimately, he could not escape this calamity; being asked made him cold all over. He lowered his gaze obediently and said respectfully:

"This subordinate... truly does not know... It was King Wei and His Highness conspiring together... People like us were all pushed to the periphery!"

There was a moment of silence in the falling snow before the great one's voice was heard, speaking slowly,

"That is your incompetence."

As soon as these words were spoken, Attendant Yang looked as if he had been struck by lightning; he knelt on the ground and kowtowed ceaselessly, saying,

"Your Excellency! The imperial palace was moved completely intact, it just changed locations... His Highness did not do much, he just... he just... has an enterprising heart!"

"An enterprising heart?"

The judge sneered and said,

"He sired two useless wastes, raised in a deep boudoir, who have cultivated for a hundred years without even killing a chicken; one's loyalties lie elsewhere, and the other is 'benevolent and merciful,' with a mind and bearing as soft as mud. Who can they possibly control!"

"A perfectly good North-South conflict, and it was fought to _that_ state above Lake Xian. You were led by the nose; even Qi Lanyan could use you as a weapon. Yang Fu must have been blind back then to choose wastes like you to carry on the line!"

Attendant Yang did not dare to rebut and remained prostrated on the ground, but the great one could not be bothered with him; his tone was ice-cold as he said indifferently,

"I can't be bothered to manage how you all make a mess; the Great Song can withstand your antics. But you'd better remember this: the Underworld's commands come first. If one day you can no longer handle the situation and call this venerable one to clean up the mess..."

He sneered, "Do not blame me for disregarding the karma from my mortal life."
