# Chapter 1287: Dao Inheritance

The sudden, wild joy made Qiao Yue kneel upon the ground, leaving him somewhat at a loss. Instead, a dreadful fear of gaining and losing gripped him, terrified he had misunderstood and would be plunged into despair, hesitant and anxious.

A smiling voice belonging to that Daoist Master drifted from the mountains,

"I wonder which young talent this might be?"

Cui Jueyin's voice was much clearer in comparison,

"Qiao Yue!"

These two words surged into Qiao Yue's heart like a blazing inferno. He took a step forward, bowed deeply once more, and said with utmost respect,

"Disciple of the Qiao clan from the former state of Boye, Qiao Yue, pays his respects to you, Lord!"

Hearing his words, Li Ximing shook his head, a smile escaping him, and said,

"Come forward, let me have a look."

The youth shuffled closer, and Li Ximing raised a hand, pressing it against the center of his brow.

'His sea of qi is abundant, cinnabar light rises in four directions, and the water and fire of his Shengyang Acupoint are in harmony... He is an Alchemist, no doubt. The formless fire of the immortal foundation lying within him is ferocious; it is the Virile Banefire of the Virile Fire Dao.'

He was born with the aptitude for pill refining and even cultivated Virile Fire, which excelled at it. Li Ximing saw the lingering scent of smoke and fire on his cuffs and the signs of scorching on three of his fingers. He was clearly a relentless alchemist, and Li Ximing nodded to himself in approval.

Cui Jueyin said:

"I met this child in Boye. He's extremely well-known in the area, famous for his high pill yield. When an ordinary person might produce three or four pills, he produces five or six, which is why he is so sought after."

Li Ximing smiled and said,

"A profound daoist tradition and the blessings of a clan’s treasures can account for an extra pill or two. One extra pill brings its own glory, but two extra pills... that is a pure, unfounded benefit. Others will naturally not look elsewhere. After all, the profession of an Alchemist is always one of two extremes: either their door is bustling with customers, or they are merely self-sufficient.”

Qiao Yue said respectfully, "This junior has been enlightened."

Li Ximing pulled a jade slip from his sleeve, casually pressed it into the young man's hand, and said,

"Read this. You have the time it takes for one incense stick to burn. Then, I will test you."

He said no more, turning to Cui Jueyin and speaking softly,

"Jueyin, Imperial Observation of the Origin… how much do you know about it?"

Li Ximing had no ambition for the Quest for Gold. The Eternal Brightness Steps had been his chosen goal, but Cui Jueyin's words from his visit to the lake that year had served as a stark reminder,

'Since you already cultivate Illumination of All Under Heaven, it is ill-advised to also cultivate Eternal Brightness Steps.'

This complicated the choice immensely. He pondered deeply for a long time, wavering constantly between Imperial Observation of the Origin and Sovereign Treading Peril. Their advantages and disadvantages were distinct, making a decision truly difficult.

'Sovereign Treading Peril has many benefits and is, to an extent, a life-saving absolute skill. But this divine ability requires one to personally brave mortal danger, to enter the fray and fight...'

Li Ximing lacked Li Zhouwei's formidable dharma body and Dao-Profundity! It was one thing to cast spell arts and control spiritual fire from the sidelines, but if he had to charge into the thick of battle, it was highly likely that rather than treading on peril, he would be leaving himself behind permanently.

'Imperial Observation of the Origin, being the superior version of Eternal Brightness Steps, is naturally excellent. But Jueyin also said that in ancient times, this secret art could not be learned by anyone outside the imperial bloodline, and its difficulty is heaven-shaking... It would likely be very troublesome.'

Li Ximing had already stumbled his way through cultivating Illumination of All Under Heaven. How could he handle Imperial Observation of the Origin, an art from a supreme mortal dao lineage like the Northern Emperor's Scripture of Wei?

If he failed a few times, it wouldn't be surprising to get stuck for sixty or seventy years. He feared that by the time Li Zhouwei attained the Gold, he, Li Ximing, would still be stuck at two divine abilities!

There was also the Chariot of the Presiding Office. Li Ximing had other thoughts about this one. This divine ability was an ancient substitute for crossing the Purple Mystery. It was the most inferior choice. If the time came and he failed to cross the Purple Mystery, only then would he consider using this divine ability to force a breakthrough.

With these considerations in mind, he used a divine ability to shield their conversation and asked with a frown:

"Eternal Brightness Steps truly cannot be cultivated alongside Illumination of All Under Heaven? Must one rely solely on Bright Heart of Clarity?"

Cui Jueyin instantly understood his meaning. Imperial Observation of the Origin was already exceedingly rare, so it was only natural the Li family lacked the subsequent dao lineage. But understanding was one thing; Cui Jueyin could only sigh,

"Daoist Master, there is something you may not know. Imperial Observation of the Origin was for an imperial prince at minimum, while Illumination of All Under Heaven was cultivated by the crown prince. This was the established order, a convention that could never be circumvented."

"After the fall of Wei, the ancestors of both the Li and Cui families lost both these divine abilities simultaneously and were desperate to find another path. I heard... an ancestor possessed a copy of the Imperial Command Scripture for Mortals to Awaken Reverence. It could supposedly be used to improve the cultivation method, harmonizing Illumination of All Under Heaven and Imperial Observation of the Origin to allow their cultivation... As long as one didn't consider the Quest for Gold, they no longer needed to match perfectly."

"It is rumored that when that lineage fled south, this item was brought along, and it very likely fell into the hands of Wanling."

Li Ximing frowned.

'Even if there _is_ a version of Illumination of All Under Heaven compatible with Eternal Brightness Steps now... I can't possibly cripple my cultivation and start over...'

A strange light flickered in Cui Jueyin's eyes as he said,

"My family ancestors searched for this method for many years, a fact this junior has always kept in mind. That year, Daoist Master took me to the Purple Smoke Gate. I spoke with a direct descendant there and learned from her that the Purple Smoke Gate once cultivated under the Wanling Upper Sect, and that they _also_ possessed a version of Illumination of All Under Heaven. I wonder..."

He was elegant and refined, yet also a clever and perceptive man, capable of nonchalantly prying secrets from others. Hearing this, Li Ximing stared at him, stunned.

Where had he, Li Ximing, obtained his Illumination of All Under Heaven?

From the Purple Smoke Gate!

'It's the very one I am cultivating? Could such a coincidence exist?'

His heart trembled. He flipped his hand, retrieved the Scripture of the Monarch's Bright Heart of Clarity, and handed it to Cui Jueyin. The Daoist Master Qing Feng examined it closely, his face filled with shock, yet he remained hesitant. Li Ximing, however, suddenly sorted through it all in his mind and felt a wave of relief.

'I understand now. It's not a coincidence. It's because the unique version of Illumination of All Under Heaven belonging to the Wei-Li direct lineage, to the Wei Crown Prince, could never have been spread to the outside world. As long as it wasn't obtained from the High Firmament Pavilion, but a Illumination of All Under Heaven I found myself—be it from the Purple Smoke Gate or anywhere else—as long as it could be cultivated... it absolutely _cannot_ be the Wei-Li Imperial Tradition!'

He didn't know whether to laugh or cry, sighing inwardly. Cui Jueyin studied it for a long time but didn't dare to draw a conclusion.

"It seems... but this subordinate's divine ability and Dao-Profundity are too low... I'm afraid you must ask King Wei!"

There was nothing wrong with his words. Li Ximing settled his mind and said,

"I understand. Send someone to Purple Smoke to inquire as well. This matter is not urgent."

Cui Jueyin performed a salute, found a side peak to establish a hall for his cultivation, and departed. Only then did Li Ximing's gaze return to Qiao Yue.

The man was drenched in sweat, one hand forming incessant gestures, his eyes tightly shut as if trapped in a nightmare. He wasn't jolted awake until Li Ximing gently set down his jade cup, leaving him standing on the mountain as if waking to a different world.

A breath later, Qiao Yue collapsed to his knees, sweat pouring from him like rain, and whispered,

"This little one's aptitude is dull... I only managed to grasp... one or two words!"

Qiao Yue's heart sank to rock bottom. He had strained every fiber of his being to make a good impression, but he hadn't expected this. Forget comprehending it, he couldn't even decipher a single sentence. He had exhausted his mind, only to grasp a mere one or two words.

Qiao Yue was an Alchemist of rare talent, yet he was momentarily disheartened. Li Ximing's face remained impassive, but inwardly, he nodded.

'Impressive.'

What Li Ximing had given him was none other than the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art!

The difficulty of this pill art was top-tier. Even Li Ximing, a Purple Mansion Realm master, had pondered it for a long time back then and benefited immensely, let alone Qiao Yue. He nodded slightly and said,

"Your sincerity is commendable."

Qiao Yue let out a breath of relief, bowed again, and rose. Li Ximing smiled at him, took three incense sticks from his sleeve, and said softly,

"My, Li Ximing's, pill arts originate from the Xiao family of Lixia Prefecture, tracing back to their ancestor, Xiao Fengqi. Your martial grand-ancestor's surname is Xiao, named Yuansi. He is currently visiting friends on the lake; you should pay him your respects."

Qiao Yue dropped to his knees, suppressing the ecstatic joy in his heart, and kowtowed.

"I will never forget Master's teachings! I will serve you with my life to repay this grace!"

Li Ximing waved his hand to stop him, drew out three more incense sticks, and said casually,

"Furthermore, my Purple Mansion Realm pill Dao originates from the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art in my hands. It is inherited from Encompassing Profundity and belongs to the Secret Enclosure Dao. You must study it diligently and remember this."

Li Ximing had first heard of the Three Profoundities from the [Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art]. Later, as his divine abilities grew and his experience broadened, his understanding of this Secret Enclosure Dao deepened. To put it bluntly, this Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art scroll was the very foundation of his pill Dao, the bedrock of his confidence in refining pills!

Even though accepting Qiao Yue as a disciple involved strategic considerations, since he had taken the man as his student, Li Ximing would not hold back. He explained this clearly, and only then did he say,

"Third..."

His gaze turned profound.

"You shall bow to this lake."

Qiao Yue obeyed each instruction. Only then did Li Ximing nod with a smile and say softly,

"Have your family return and deliver the news. You will stay here in the mountains... You also have a disciple-brother, an in-name disciple of mine. You should meet him."

With these words, whether the members of the Qiao clan were short-sighted or discerning, they would all surely weep with overwhelming joy. Hearing this, Qiao Yue himself was on the verge of tears. He nodded repeatedly and kowtowed.

"Master's grace! Qiao Yue and the Qiao clan will forever remember it!"

Li Ximing, however, made no grand gesture. He watched the young man depart, his brow furrowing slightly as his voice dropped.

"Suihuan... what is it?"

As expected, the golden-eyed youth stepped forward, saluted, and said,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, the Ju clan has presented a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist scripture."

Li Ximing was initially unconcerned, merely raising an eyebrow. But when Li Suihuan presented the Daoist scripture and his spiritual sense swept over it, his expression changed slightly.

He turned to the side, listened to Li Suihuan's full report without speaking for a long time, and then smiled.

"Suihuan, what is your assessment of these two men?"

Li Suihuan bowed and replied softly,

"Daoist Qiao has a fine reputation, is naturally talented, and possesses the aptitude for the Purple Mansion Realm. He can inherit a Dao undertaking. But when it comes to discerning the greater situation, understanding the stakes, and judging the times, Ju Liangwang is the one who is extremely capable."

"He is sending his clan's disciples into the Milin Mountains. First, to build connections with the direct lineage. Second, to preserve his bloodline."

The Family Head said quietly,

"Several direct descendants at the Embryonic Breathing stage, sent to the Milin Mountains. Since they are to build their Foundation Establishment, it will take them fifty or sixty years. This guarantees them fifty or sixty years of peace. In just one or two generations, they can connect to my family's peak fortune and survive the most difficult transitional period after moving south."

"Furthermore, Jianghuai is filling up, and cultivators are growing more numerous. The Milin Mountains connect the north and south; they are destined for prosperity. Even if the Ju clan only gets twenty or thirty percent of that, they won't lack for ordinary resources for decades. What's more... all the major families are in the market city, and the Ju clan still has a foundation. As long as they have a pretext for a long-term residence, even if they can't befriend our direct line, it wouldn't be difficult to use benefits to arrange marriages with the likes of the Chen, An, Tian, or Ding families. With relationships interlocking and steady progress, it's a reliable support."

"There is also the worst-case scenario. If this junior is not mistaken, his request for the Ju clan to establish merchant pavilions here... the servants and helpers who arrive will all be the Ju clan's direct-line mortals."

A strange look entered his eyes.

"If one day chaos erupts in Jianghuai, or the Ju clan suffers a calamity and faces annihilation, they will have direct descendants and Purple Mansion blood in the Milin Mountains. They will have their stationed Qi Refining cultivators in the market city, all of whom are capable core members, accompanied by numerous Ju family mortals who came to 'help'... With a single command, they could all gather in one place. Would that not be a new Ju clan?"

Li Ximing stroked his beard and shook his head.

"A pity."

Li Suihuan also understood his meaning. The gap between Ju Liangwang and Qiao Yue was far more than just the pill Dao. Qiao Yue's advantage was his youth and promise. This Ju Family Head's cultivation wasn't low, but he was old, and it seemed he no longer had any chance of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Li Suihuan replied,

"This junior's meaning is... we might as well grant his request. This matter is also quite beneficial to us. The Ju clan's bloodline is respectable, and this man is undeniably capable. If he can be put to our use, it would be a boon."

Li Ximing smiled.

"Since you understand his intentions, I grant you full authority to handle it. As for what 'use' he might be... that's hard to say."

The Li family had many Purple Mansion cultivators now, and Li Ximing's own divine abilities had deepened with time. He gradually understood why ancient cultivators said that any true cultivation meant the Purple Mansion Realm. Without divine abilities, so-called Foundation Establishment cultivators were useless, no matter how many one had. Raising them was a waste of spiritual qi. If he, Li Ximing, hadn't been burdened with an entire clan, he truly would have been like the Purple Mansion masters of old, keeping only one or two capable assistants.

No matter how powerful a Foundation Establishment cultivator was, without the opportunity to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, they were still _just_ Foundation Establishment.

Li Suihuan bowed. Li Ximing glanced at his cultivation, noting his true essence was consummate. He had clearly taken a pill long ago and had been at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm for some years. He nodded.

"Your true essence is consummate. You can now glimpse the gate of wonders—_this_ is the real good news."

Li Suihuan's cultivation was extremely solid, his aura complete. He bowed and said respectfully,

"I reached the late stage many years ago. Daoist Master Suyun already made arrangements and fetched three secret methods for this junior to cultivate. She instructed that as soon as I succeed with one, I am to find her."

Li Ximing fell into contemplation.

Li Suihuan cultivated the Double Radiance Fire Scripture. This Radiant Fire Dao inheritance came with three secret methods, which didn't seem low-grade. However, as Li Ximing's choice for the next generation's Daoist Master, and as Li Zhouwei's direct grandson, Li Ximing was in no hurry for him to advance. The more secret methods, the more stable his foundation, which was for the best.

'Three methods... that really isn't many. If only I could get him some better ones...'

Thus, he personally asked about Li Suihuan's cultivation progress, pointing out a few key apertures to guide him. Li Suihuan thoughtfully committed it all to memory and also withdrew. Only then did Li Ximing rise and tap lightly.

The golden pill furnace before him lifted from the ground, revealing the blazing, crimson fire vein beneath. Wisps of transparent and pale purple flame danced within it, a wave of heat blasting his face. A pill was hidden within!

The pill's own flames were hazy, as if veiled in white gauze. It was precisely the great Virile Fire pill Li Zhouwei had obtained from the Governing Yang Grotto!

The Li family had obtained two pills from Luoxia. Besides this one, the other was a Wei clan great pill of Radiant Fire, also made from incredibly precious materials. Li Ximing had hidden that one away long ago, preparing it for Li Jiangqian to cross the Purple Mystery or to rapidly increase his divine ability.

As for the pill before him now, he had studied it in secret for a long time and had already made discoveries.

'The materials were priceless, and it was nurtured for a thousand years. Its healing properties are its most minor function. It has gathered all kinds of Virile Fire spiritual essences. Once this pill enters the body, it must be hidden and nurtured; it absolutely cannot be depleted in a short time.'

Li Ximing estimated that if he were to consume this pill, the spirit pill would remain in his sea of qi for at least twenty years!

'For twenty years, it will provide an unceasing supply. Whether for healing, fueling the dharma power of divine abilities, or for cultivation, it will be effective. In those twenty years, I would certainly rise to a new level, causing my immortal foundation to repeatedly condense and accelerating the consummation of my divine abilities.'

Li Ximing was naturally reluctant to consume such a precious item. And since its nature was 'Molten', it could not be carelessly exposed. Thus, Li Ximing had sealed it within the fire vein.

He observed it carefully for a time, ensuring the pill would not decline while inside the fire vein, before settling the golden pill furnace back down to suppress it. Glancing around, he suddenly realized that after so many years, he finally had an opportunity to advance his spell arts.

He let out a self-deprecating laugh, took out the Tread on Flames, and began to practice the rusty footwork once more. He allowed the sun and moon to alternate around him, light and dark shifting, as he buried himself in cultivation.
