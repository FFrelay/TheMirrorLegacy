# Chapter 1350: Malice

The old man and the youth departed from the side hall, both feeling as if they had survived a disaster, their skin slick with cold sweat. Seeing the sneering Qiao Wenliu waiting to receive them, they spoke even less, not daring to meet his gaze as they headed straight for the main hall.

The main hall was brilliantly lit.

Li Zhouwei sat upon the high seat, utterly silent. He toyed with a golden bracelet, its form flickering back and forth in his hand like a golden shadow.

A man stood below.

This man was exceptionally tall, with a slightly ruddy complexion and brows as sharp as if carved by a knife. He wore an impassive expression, neither servile nor overbearing. Although the one seated above was the renowned King Wei, his demeanor was calm, betraying no sign of nervousness.

‘Ye Tuji…’

Beside him, Li Ximing’s brow furrowed as he sensed the man’s profound composure.

He spoke softly, “Fellow Daoist, from what land do you hail?”

Ye Tuji glanced at him and smiled.

“This Ye hails from Baishi Prefecture. The two of you have likely never heard of it; it is but a small prefecture in the east.”

He paused, his expression turning serious.

“Let us dispense with the pleasantries. I request to see Daoist Master Gu!”

As his voice echoed, Pang Yi and his father entered from the side, standing with reverence.

“Pang Queyun and Pang Yi pay our respects to King Wei!”

Ye Tuji, at the front, heard the commotion but did not turn back, seemingly unconcerned with where the father-son pair had been for the past incense stick of time. Just as the sound faded, Yu Xixin entered, holding a profound urn.

The Great Daoist Master of Purple Qi came to a halt. On one hand, he used a divine ability to constrain the Spiritual Treasure; on the other, he raised a shimmer of water, causing the urn to tilt. At once, a stream of glittering, illusory colors flowed out.

Yu Xixin made a gesture of invitation. Ye Tuji strode forward to the profound urn, sensed the aura within, and only then turned his head to say, “Fellow Daoists!”

Pang Yi stepped forward, feeling the aura of Converging Water. He then turned to look at the old man beside him. Pang Queyun stood indecisively for a moment before Ye Tuji pinched off the divine ability and said indifferently,

“Is that Senior Gu inside? Great Daoist Master Gu?!”

These words rang out, but the only response was the steady, seemingly unwavering aura of Converging Water. Pang Yi did not know if the person inside could hear, but he was already sneering in his heart.

‘You might as well ask… if the one defeated and captured alive by King Wei is Gu You of Blazing Aridity Heaven.’

‘That man is the very soul of arrogance, unafraid even of death. It would be a miracle if he answered you!’

He sneered internally while inclining his ear to listen. Beside him, Li Ximing frowned but did not speak.

Ye Tuji, however, prompted, “Senior Pang?”

Pang Queyun placed his hand upon the Spiritual Treasure, briefly sensing and assessing it. Understanding dawned in his heart. He performed a salute, took a silent step back, and then finally heard King Wei speak from above,

“I have seen Great Daoist Master Longkang's desire for preservation. This king will grant Blazing Aridity Heaven some face and not rashly resort to arms. Since Bright Yang rides the momentum of a great victory, Chun City should naturally send someone to sue for peace. Tell Longkang Yao to come and speak with me personally.”

“Otherwise… they need only look to the sky and see it filled with Converging Water.”

Pang Yi and his father returned the salute together. Only then did they hear Li Ximing laugh from the side.

“Oh, right. There is also that fellow with the surname Wen. We really cannot be bothered to expend the energy to suppress him.”

A smile touched the corner of Ye Tuji's lips. He gave a deep bow and replied,

“This Ye will certainly deliver King Wei’s message.”

He turned and left the great hall without a hint of reluctance. Pang Yi quickly bowed to Yu Xixin in thanks before they departed together.

Outside the main hall, Wu Miao stood to the side. Witnessing the scene, he felt a deep displeasure at Ye Tuji’s composure, and his brow furrowed. QQiao Wenliu had never been one to show warmth. The group received not a single friendly expression, resembling defeated soldiers as they hastily fled the city and journeyed east.

The great hall fell into a sudden silence. Yu Xixin put away the Spiritual Treasure and let out a breath, looking somewhat relieved.

“Great Daoist Master Longkang must be worried. If we can turn blades into jade, that would be for the best…”

He was, after all, a man who cherished his reputation and did not wish for a great war between the two sides. Li Zhouwei nodded and dismissed him. He then saw the youth in the crimson robe enter briskly from the side, offer a salute, and say with a smile, “Father!”

“Is it done?”

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile, his voice growing cold.

“Done or not, it must be so. Before, they were in the shadows while we were in the light. Now, we hold them in our grasp. Father need only make a trip to Chun City, and they will surely collapse! It is merely a question of whether that Daoist Master Longkang’s awakening is thorough enough…”

He cupped his hands in a salute and continued softly, “That man is called Fu He, and he has others behind him. He is not the type to accomplish things. In fact, his methods are inferior to Pang Yi’s.”

After hearing him clarify the details, Li Zhouwei stood up, descended the steps, and turned his head with a smile.

“Let them contend for a while first.”

…

Once outside the great formation, Pang Yi covertly glanced at his father. Pang Queyun’s expression was unchanged as he heard his son’s discreet inquiry, ‘Father, was the person inside real or fake?’

Pang Queyun’s voice was grave as he replied, ‘I estimate that it was real… Gu You might be refusing to speak, or perhaps King Wei is preventing him from speaking. Besides, whether it is real or fake no longer matters. What happens next depends entirely on you!’

Pang Yi’s heart settled slightly.

But Ye Tuji seemed to have his doubts. He stood within the Great Void, propelled by his divine ability, and said coolly,

“The two of you were an incense stick of time slower than I. I wonder what you might have heard in the side hall…”

Pang Yi shook his head and sighed.

“It was Daoist Master Yu, of course. He met us in the side hall and we spoke of old times. Now that we belong to opposing sides, our hearts are naturally heavy. But these are not things that can be conveniently repeated back home, otherwise I would have spoken to fellow Daoist Ye about it sooner.”

Ye Tuji ultimately trusted him. After all, from any perspective, the three of them were on the same side. He nodded, seeming to understand his meaning, and said,

“I will report this matter. I will just mention it briefly and pass it along.”

This place was exceedingly close to Chun City. In merely an instant, mountain-like phenomena appeared in the Great Void. The group broke through together, crossing layers of mountain ranges, and soon landed in the small bluestone town.

The three of them said not a word, crossing the lake in silence and landing in the small pavilion by its shore. Longkang Yao still maintained his posture, hands clasped behind his back. Lu An held a tea tray, identical to how he was when the three had left, as if only a moment had passed.

Evidently, from start to finish, these three had been waiting here together!

What was different, however, was Longkang Yao’s icy expression. The shock and anger in his eyes seemed ready to spill over, making Pang Yi’s heart thump as he sensed trouble.

The three of them saluted in unison and said, “We pay our respects to the lords!”

The pavilion remained silent, save for an extra paper talisman on the jade table that curled slightly in the wind. Lu An’s expression was quite unsightly as he swept his gaze over the two of them and said,

“What you may not know is that while you were heading west, Vast Plateau Heaven sent someone down. Out of concern for the Longkang clan, they sent this talisman. They said their calculations show… that Daoist Master Gu is well, his strength having diminished by only ten or twenty percent.”

Pang Queyun looked at the frigid Longkang Yao before him and said hesitantly,

“What… what sort of omen is this?”

Fu He, who had been standing to the side with his arms crossed, heard this and spoke with a smile,

“This is a most unfavorable omen. I will not even mention whether preserving Daoist Master Gu’s strength makes him difficult to suppress… If there was any intention of releasing him, he must be beaten until he is severely injured, unable to act for three to five years… is that not so? King Wei has always coveted the immortal land of our Gu Prefecture, so how could he possibly allow Daoist Master Gu to maintain nearly his full strength?”

“Regardless of the motive, even for the convenience of suppressing him, he must ensure Daoist Master Gu is severely wounded. Who would bind a tiger without drawing its claws? This state must have been concealed with Exiled Qi! There is no need to think further!”

This was an excellent point. Even Lu An lowered his head without a word, clearly persuaded.

“Why use Exiled Qi for concealment? There must be a scheme afoot.”

'He finally hit the mark, not so stupid after all… just too green,’ Pang Yi applauded him in his heart with a touch of disdain.

After saying this, Fu He lowered his gaze.

“This junior’s earnest heart can be witnessed by heaven and earth!”

The Longkang Yao before them was already extremely agitated. The arrival of this talisman had made all previous speculations terrifyingly close to reality. He finally looked the man in the eyes and said softly,

“You have my thanks.”

His gaze shifted, cold and hard, as he asked,

“Tuji—what happened?”

Ye Tuji offered a salute and replied, “This junior was first left to the side, with no one approaching. After a good while, a cultivator came to lead the way, but only permitted me to enter alone…”

Longkang Yao stared at him, his brow deeply furrowed.

“Later… upon reaching the main hall, I saw no one else, only King Wei and that Daoist Master Zhaojing. The Daoist Master beat around the bush, asking many questions.”

The Great Daoist Master turned his head with sharp perception and said coldly,

“Oh? So Daoist Master Pang met someone else?”

Ye Tuji was clearly trying to cover for Pang Yi, but deceiving Longkang Yao with such details was far too difficult. Without a second thought, Pang Yi knelt and said in a low voice,

“It was Daoist Master Yu… He had a premonition that our two sides were heading for war. Filled with worry, he used the task of inquiring for news as a pretense to meet us privately. It was also a warning… he said… that a petty person in King Wei’s service was speaking slander, and the words were aimed directly at my Pang Clan!”

As he said this, his face seemed to hold infinite complexity. His eyes glanced furtively at Fu He, but Fu He saw a golden opportunity and had no gaze to return, rejoicing inwardly:

‘Excellent, excellent, it must be that brute Qiao Sanyi! Li Zhouwei, your judgment of character is poor, you have pushed the Pang Clan over to my side!’

Pang Yi received no response and simply prostrated himself on the ground, saying nothing more. Ye Tuji immediately continued,

“After quite some time, we were finally able to see Daoist Master Yu come up. Only then did we see a Spiritual Treasure used for suppression, which should be the Heavenly Nurture Urn. A wisp of aura was drawn out, which seemed authentic, so this junior spoke up to inquire…”

Ye Tuji’s voice lowered.

“There was no answer.”

Longkang Yao’s expression changed slightly. He stared straight at him and said, “Only a wisp of aura was revealed?”

Ye Tuji said solemly, “Correct. It was not yet clear whether it was strong or weak.”

He raised his head and said softly, “However, King Wei passed along a message. He comes riding the tide of victory. If the Great Daoist Master wants to spare Daoist Master Gu’s life and sue for peace, he invites the Great Daoist Master to come to the city and find him personally. Otherwise… the heavens will surely be filled with Converging Water!”

“Sue for peace?”

Fu He prostrated himself and exclaimed in alarm, “Great Daoist Master, you absolutely must not go! Senior Gu has certainly met with misfortune. Bright Yang has a grand scheme!”

The atmosphere in the pavilion had condensed to its absolute limit, the only sound being the roaring flames that burned around Longkang Yao. 

His voice carried a deep hatred, “So it is truly so!”

From the perspective of interests and the greater picture, Longkang Yao absolutely did not believe the other party would eliminate Gu You. But Bright Yang was an exception that made him hesitate for a rare moment—when cultivators of this Dao lineage were provoked, they were capable of anything! With all sorts of evidence now laid before him, he could not help but believe it!

Fu He simply knelt on the ground, presenting a bamboo slip with both hands, his voice sincere,

“Father has already left the Grotto-Heaven. As long as the Great Daoist Master sends a letter, he will certainly seek justice for the various families of our Gu Prefecture!”

A few cold laughs squeezed from Longkang Yao’s throat.

“Seek justice…”

He took a step forward, but heard a rustling sound. Longkang Yao turned his head slightly to see Pang Yi, his face covered in cold sweat, take a step forward and then stumble, kneeling before him with a thud.

He cried out, “Great Daoist Master, wait!”

Following this was Pang Queyun’s deep sigh. The old man looked up at the sky, his eyes shut tight, and said in a low voice,

“Great Daoist Master…”

It happened in a flash. Fu He was still standing frozen in place, not knowing what this father and son were about to say, but Ye Tuji had already whipped his head around and said with a laugh,

“I just remembered! In the main hall earlier, Brother Pang entered a step behind me. He must have heard something he needed to say—I have never heard that you were acquainted with the Li Clan. Why would there be a need for a private conversation?”

Pang Queyun ignored him completely, only raising his hands and saying in a low voice,

“Since I, Pang, have received the Great Daoist Master’s command to supervise, I cannot leave these words unsaid—by the secret arts of my Azure Profundity, I fear that within that Spiritual Treasure is Daoist Master Gu himself!”

The two men’s words nearly overlapped. The aura around Longkang Yao condensed to its peak. His eyes, burning with roaring flames, turned to Pang Queyun for an instant, then shifted to Ye Tuji. The hands he had raised, he now placed behind his back once more.

Without hesitation, Pang Yi raised his face, slick with cold sweat, and stared directly at Longkang Yao. He said hoarsely,

“Great Daoist Master, only if you guarantee the safety of my Pang Clan can this junior speak!”

The hands behind Longkang Yao’s back had already clenched into tight fists, the flames on his body like agitated vipers.

“Speak!”

The instant Pang Yi parted his lips, Ye Tuji’s voice forcefully interjected. He boomed,

“Who did you meet in the side hall! What favor did you receive! And now you dare to interfere in the affairs of the world! Do you dare to answer!”

His voice exploded for a moment. Longkang Yao’s face had already turned toward him, his eyes transforming into crimson, jewel-like crystals. Profound patterns erupted across his face, and small clusters of feathers burst from his cheeks along the meridians. His voice became sharp in an instant.

“Silence!”

_Boom!_

A sea of fire exploded between heaven and earth, instantly dyeing the entire sky crimson. Ye Tuji spat out flames and retreated several steps, bending over and coughing violently. Pang Yi felt a searing pain on his face and cried out, fast and urgent,

“Why would I not dare to answer—the one this junior met was Daoist Master Yu!”

Longkang Yao was turned sideways to him, listening as the youth said with hatred,

“Great Daoist Master! Inside the Spiritual Treasure is clearly and plainly Daoist Master Gu!”

This statement was utterly malicious. When it fell on Fu He’s ears, his expression changed drastically—how could he have imagined his childhood friend would turn on him at this moment! Fu He’s reaction was more than half a beat too slow. He felt the world spin, a chill shooting up to his mind. Forcing himself to remain calm, he seized on the other’s words and sneered,

“It seems fellow Daoist was hit so hard by King Wei’s spiritual item that you no longer know who you are! If it really is Daoist Master Gu in the Spiritual Treasure, why did he not say a word! Are you suggesting that the Spiritual Treasure blocked his speech, that King Wei intentionally prevented you from hearing!”

Pang Yi let out a cold laugh, raised his head, and pointed a hand straight at Ye Tuji.

“It is, of course, because of him!”

This declaration made Longkang Yao narrow his eyes. Pang Yi said with hatred,

“Great Daoist Master! When this person went to ask questions, his words were provocative, his tone cold. He actually asked if the one trapped inside was Daoist Master Gu. What a joke! All the Grotto-Heavens know that Daoist Master Gu is arrogant by nature. To be captured by King Wei after a defeat has already filled him with the resolve to die. How could he possibly answer such a question!”

“It was clearly done on purpose!”

In truth, while Ye Tuji’s words were not flattering, they were by no means provocative. After all, King Wei was not deaf. He had merely, within the bounds of what was permissible, tried to make it so that Daoist Master Gu would not answer. Furthermore… given Gu You’s temperament, in such a humiliating situation, he might not have spoken even if coaxed with kind words. But with no witnesses present, whatever Pang Yi said was the truth. Who could find fault in it?

Even Ye Tuji himself must be feeling uncertain!

Pang Yi gave the other no chance to argue. He immediately prostrated himself, closed his eyes, and said sternly,

“When this Ye Tuji was chosen, this junior already had his suspicions. I merely felt that Daoist Master Fu was wise and would not let private matters interfere with public duty. I never imagined it would come to this. This junior must now speak! Ye Tuji is no rogue cultivator! He is Fu He’s childhood friend, an inside man they placed here long ago. They have been plotting against the Great Daoist Master for more than a day or two!”

This final sentence was like a clap of thunder, exploding within the pavilion.

Pang Yi had intended to sow discord and had come prepared. Fu He was already in disarray and could not withstand such a series of attacks. He was unable to respond for a moment, his entire body turning cold.

“You… you’re spouting nonsense! You have already accepted benefits from King Wei!”

Pang Yi flew into a rage at these words, turning and raising his head to curse:

“Fu He! Search your heart and ask yourself! Who was it that used underhanded tricks with King Wei… and now you dare accuse me of currying favor with him… If your people had not surrendered to King Wei’s side, spouting endless slander, saying I was sowing discord, why would I have been placed in the side hall!”

“Your calculations were clever indeed. You wanted Ye Tuji to meet King Wei alone, to prevent my father and I from seeing Daoist Master Gu… But you did not expect that Daoist Master Yu, unwilling to see Daoist Master Gu perish, would specifically meet us in the side hall and bring us to the main hall… Otherwise, the Great Daoist Master would have been deceived by you today!”

This speech was an act of genius, turning defense into offense. The weakness of the Pang father and son having a private meeting, which raised suspicions of them being bought, had become the very weapon he used to accuse Fu He!

These questions made Fu He’s entire face flush with blood.

He said hoarsely, “What are you talking about… When have I ever! When have I ever!”

A flicker of understanding passed through Pang Yi’s eyes, but the expression on his face grew even more sorrowful. He turned and knelt to the ground.

“My lord, someone directed a cultivator to speak utter nonsense before King Wei, saying all manner of slander about my Pang Clan! The goal was to force my Pang Clan to collude with them out of self-preservation, to make the Great Daoist Master and King Wei fight to the bitter end!”

Pang Yi lifted his head, his eyes filled with hatred, and said through gritted teeth,

“But this junior dares not!”

“This junior grew up in Gu Prefecture. How could I bear to watch this land be plunged into misery and death by a few provocations… Great Daoist Master! Although my father and I do not wish to cause trouble, we have always remembered the principle that if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold!”

He raised his head, two streams of clear tears finally flowing down his face at the perfect moment.

“Daoist Master Yu had only one sentence for me to bring to you, my lord…”

Longkang Yao’s perpetually fixed gaze finally shifted slightly, staring at him.

Pang Yi said hoarsely, “If a cultivator from the grotto-heaven arrives, then Gu You will not return!”

Longkang Yao slightly lowered his eyes, listening as the youth continued.

“Great Daoist Master, villains are at work. My Pang Clan’s path to Bright Yang has been severed, but I am unwilling to offer up the lives of my fellow Daoists to curry favor with those above. Now, I can only rely on the Great Daoist Master! Every word is true… They… they are doing this to force you into battle! They are doing this to get Daoist Master Gu killed!”

Fu He was practically dizzy from his words but knew he could not let this continue. He also knelt, his voice anxious.

“Great Daoist Master! This man has been bought by King Wei. This is to stir up people's hearts and make the Great Daoist Master hesitate! He absolutely cannot be trusted!”

Compared to Pang Yi's heart-piercing words, Fu He’s seemed somewhat feeble. He could only seize upon that previous point again and say with hatred,

“How do you explain that Daoist Master Gu is almost unharmed!”

Pang Yi’s lips trembled, but he did not continue speaking—words that the Li Clan had intentions of retreating could not possibly come from his mouth!

And so, there was silence.

Longkang Yao stood with his hands behind his back, listening as these words echoed in his ears. Unexpectedly, at this moment, he grew calm, his eyes sweeping over everyone in the hall like a placid, ancient well.

Earlier, Fu He’s words were like daggers to the heart, and Longkang Yao suspected his sincerity. Now, Pang Yi’s words were cried with tears of blood, and he found it difficult to discern the truth. Yet, the panic and shock on Fu He’s face did not seem feigned, serving as a silent reminder to him.

‘I cannot believe all of it.’

He raised his head and lifted Pang Yi. At this moment, Daoist Master Longkang finally revealed the ruthlessness befitting a direct immortal descendant of a True Monarch. He no longer feigned any so-called respect, simply lifting the youth to be level with his own gaze and saying softly,

“If what you say is true, I will guarantee the Pang Clan’s safety… but… if something has truly happened to Gu You… your Pang Clan cannot bear the crime of plotting against me…”

His eyes were crimson, as if about to devour someone. He gave the other no chance to reply, turning his head to look at Fu He and Ye Tuji, and said coolly,

“Fu He, this Daoist Master will ask you one last time.”

“You.”

He took a step forward and said softly, “Do you represent Dongmu, or do you represent the Fu Clan of Gu Prefecture.”

This question was more terrifying than any about Gu You’s life or death. Longkang Yao’s voice echoed between heaven and earth. Though calm, it made Fu He lower his head with some difficulty.

Was Longkang Yao giving him a choice?

Not at all.

From the very beginning, Fu He never had the slightest possibility of representing Dongmu. Let alone him, even if his father were here, he absolutely could not give that answer. Longkang Yao’s meaning was singular.

This matter had to be tied to the entire Fu Clan. He had to use the entire Fu Clan as a guarantee!

‘Impossible… Gu You cannot be unharmed. If that were the case, Li Zhouwei would definitely have told Pang Yi. Unless… they also despise Pang Yi and will not cooperate with him. But no matter what, I cannot retreat now…’

Betrayed by his dear friend, his mind was in complete chaos. All sorts of thoughts, true and false, intertwined and mixed together, leaving even him somewhat confused. But he understood he had no other choice. Even though he wished he could swallow the Pang Yi before him alive right now, he could only raise his head, shut his eyes tightly, and say,

“This junior… is utterly sincere, solely for the sake of the great families of our Gu Prefecture!”
