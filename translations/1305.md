# Chapter 1305: Monarch Awaits

‘Cheng Xunzhi...’

The True Fire blazed in the heavens, having just delivered those icy words, and now it crisscrossed the sky, blocking the path of the sword immortal. Amidst the vast and indistinct profound light, one could faintly glimpse the sword immortal's cold face.

A pear-blossom rain of swords had already traversed the sky, the Governing Life Spirit shining with myriad colors as it stripped away the vast golden energy, finally landing upon the massive rift that stretched between heaven and earth.

This myriad profound light met the blazing, infernal flames and, like melting lacquer, scattered down in droplets, gradually withering within the firestorm, never able to reach the Daoist Master's eyes.

"Fellow Daoist Cheng."

Tianque's voice was calm.

"Reflecting Metal is the very essence of Metal; it does not stoop to mix with common lead, but rather uses impurities to entice, thus enabling it to advance, far more wondrously than before, with its only fear being injury from fire—upon seeing fire, it flows and changes like water."

While this Daoist Master Tianque was indeed a Great Daoist Master of the True Fire Dao, he was also a direct descendant of the Golden Oneness tradition, a great cultivator of the Zhang family, and the successor to the True Monarch Golden Oneness Taiyuan of Highest Azure!

His understanding of Metal Virtue was far greater than that of any ordinary Daoist Master, and as for the transformations of divine abilities between Reflecting Metal and Geng-Metal, it was something his own Dao could not match; his words already pointed to Cheng Xunzhi's fourth divine ability, one that diverged from his original Dao.

The flames on Tianque's body showed no sign of retreating, flowing between heaven and earth as his gaze remained calm.

"Your metal is not true, not pure, not uniform, and not correct; it cannot overcome my Innate Governing Life Fire."

The sword immortal outside the True Fire was not surprised, and he spoke indifferently,

"I will defeat you with a sword of pure intent."

The interweaving True Fire and golden sword had captured everyone's attention, the space between heaven and earth shimmering brightly, when another pillar of pure white, illusory light surged forth, connecting heaven and earth and drawing the gazes of all the divine abilities present!

Within the white light was a Profound-Mystery Diagram, depicting ten thousand encircling peaks and crisscrossing ravines, layered with dense rock, among which one could faintly glimpse Daoist temples with grand brackets, deep eaves, and a blue and white color scheme!

‘The Long Shrine Profound-Mystery Diagram!’

In that instant, several brilliant clashes of spells in the sky shattered, and a bronze sword shot across several miles, unhesitatingly abandoning the woman on the ground as it streaked toward the heavens.

Han Ling seized the opportunity but did not join the chase; instead, with perfect timing, she took a single step, traversing the sky and raising her sword, her figure as ethereal as water, her beautiful eyes devoid of any superfluous emotion as her longsword pointed directly at the blue-robed youth!

This direct descendant of the Han Family took everyone by surprise, her killing intent so decisive, her arrival so sudden.

But how could Su Yan sit and wait for death? The deep blue light around him intensified as he reversed his longsword, blocking in front of himself, radiance flowing as he unexpectedly met force with force, receiving her attack with his own longsword!

In an instant, myriad streams of Pit Water light and the vast radiance of a divine ability surged forth; it was as if a deep sea had fallen from the heavens, crashing down like mountains and rain, resonating with the divine ability within him.

Boundless Ocean!

The two combined, unexpectedly neutralizing the Great Daoist Master's sword strike in a single instant.

The expression in Han Ling's eyes, however, changed.

That glittering Boundless Ocean was like a heavy hammer, shattering the last trace of probing in the eyes of this Great Daoist Master, a direct descendant of the Han Family who cultivated the Three Yin and was known as the Celestial Wall Moon Radiance Profound Body; only icy killing intent remained.

Pit Water possessed six divine abilities, and Golden Oneness was, nominally, its subordinate. It was impossible for them to find someone to seek the orthodox position and openly oppose Luoxia. Since Su Yan had cultivated Boundless Ocean, combining that with the cunning, diplomatic nature of Golden Oneness, the answer was obvious.

‘This man... is destined to come and contend for the Surplus Position! Using Boundless Ocean to claim the surplus... it truly is the Dao of aiding the overflow!’

In the brief instant he revealed his divine ability, Su Yan had become the Dao-contention enemy of Han Ling, the Great Daoist Master of Mansion Water!

And so, the devastatingly beautiful woman raised her head to look directly at the youth, the osmanthus mark on her brow, reflected in his own, suddenly flaring bright. Her slender hands drew back, held before her chest as her vermilion lips parted slightly,

"I pray for..."

"The Spiritual Radiance Light of Supreme Yin!"

The osmanthus mark brightened instantly, pure white as snow, a light as gentle as moonlight—it was just a single wisp, yet it emanated an extreme coldness, causing the many divine abilities in the sky to look over, their gazes filled with shock.

Su Yan watched with utter disbelief.

This streak of white suddenly magnified before his eyes!

The dignified Great Daoist Master of the Han Clan, a descendant of Yuanxia, Han Ling, who had always presented a gentle and amiable image, was actually using a Supreme Yin art from the Three Yin—on just the second exchange, against a mere early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!

Amidst the vast radiance in the sky, Su Yan only had time to shift his gaze, making an almost imperceptible nodding motion.

In that instant, myriad bells and chimes rang out, drums thundered to the heavens, long proclamations of ranked ministers and the sounding of profound mysteries were heard, and feudal lords appeared in formation, galloping forth to all regions, fiercely entangling with the light of Supreme Yin.

All that power seemed to transfer in an instant, landing on the surface of the sea nearby, and the blue-robed youth seized the chance to retreat a step, holding his precious sword in a reverse grip, still shaken.

Han Ling's gaze wavered, and her vermilion lips parted slightly.

Uniting the Flourishing Light.

Upper Rite!

On the glittering surface of the sea, a middle-aged man approached with his hands clasped behind his back.

He had a high-bridged nose and broad cheeks, an air of refined elegance, and wore a yellow-white feather cloak over a bright white robe, with a sword carried on his back; his skin was fair, and he held a twelve-angled, glazed-body, bronze-based palace lantern, which cast a soft, pale yellow light.

The ambient energy between heaven and earth seemed to tense abruptly, and the sword immortal's gaze slowly swept past, his sharp line of sight stirring sword-mark-like ripples upon the water's surface.

"Yan Jianxiao..."

Daoist Master Changxiao, Yan Jianxiao!

After so many years, he had reappeared, just like Chi Buzi, and at this same place teeming with experts and contending divine abilities!

His expression remained composed, and a jade disk by his side spun continuously, having apparently collected that wisp of Supreme Yin light; it looked overly full, wobbling constantly as it prevented the light from escaping.

Back then, Changxiao had casually driven Li Ximing out to sea, acting with complete ease. He hadn't used a single divine ability, yet he had beaten Li Ximing half to death, and only now, in this grotto-heaven, did he reveal his Upper Rite divine ability!

Only Yan Jianxiao, with the coordination of his divine ability and Spiritual Treasure, could so calmly contain the Supreme Yin light of a direct Three Yin descendant!

And he himself, a smile on his face, crossed a vast expanse of water in a single step to stand beside the blue-robed man, his willow-leaf eyes holding a trace of amusement.

"Fellow Daoist Su... no need to panic."

This Daoist Master, a rare sight in the world who had obtained the inheritance of Encompassing Profundity, seemed extremely confident, his voice carrying a reassuring gentleness:

"Stay within ten metres of me; unless someone at the perfection stage of the divine ability realm attacks, no one can harm a hair on your head."

Su Yan's gaze was calm as he silently moved a step closer, holding the deep blue sword horizontally before him.

This Upper Rite Great Daoist Master then shifted his gaze, gave a deep bow, and smiled.

"Greetings, Immortal Fairy. It is rare to meet a fellow Daoist of Encompassing Profundity."

Han Ling's gaze was somewhat complicated, flickering over his face for a moment before she uttered just a few words.

"A fellow Daoist of which Dao lineage, I wonder."

The last word echoed through the sky, and wind stirred between heaven and earth; the longsword had already shot forth, rapidly magnifying in the man's eyes!

She still chose to attack!

The light of Mansion Water spread out in an instant, and Changxiao's voice rang out in approval.

"Impressive! To think a Fellow Daoist could cultivate mere Mansion Water to such a degree!"

Radiance trembled in the sky as Han Ling's long hair billowed out, Changxiao's eyes reflecting the interweaving colors of Mansion Water and Supreme Yin; Supreme Yin touched the water, the Mansion Water guarded the Yin, and as the lights merged, the woman's face lost a fraction of its color, yet she showed not a hint of hesitation!

She had no intention of dragging this out—Xiao Chuting could not afford to wait, and now that she had attacked, there was only one path forward, all the way to the end!

She was, after all, of the Yuanxia Immortal Clan; a trace of solemnity finally flashed in Changxiao's eyes as he suddenly raised the lamp in his hand, his divine ability illuminating and spreading outward along the pale yellow light.

Gathering of Illuminated Hearts!

The distance between the two seemed to stretch infinitely in that moment as their brilliant attacks collided, but the woman suddenly released her grip, letting the longsword fly free; it vanished like a venomous snake, only to reappear, leaping up right in front of the Great Daoist Master!

‘A Supreme Yin art!’

Facing such a wondrous technique, Changxiao was fearless; in terms of Daoist Tradition, he had received the direct inheritance of Encompassing Profundity, and in terms of temperament, he had fought his way out from seas of people—how could he be unprepared? Since Han Ling was giving it her all, he would not be disrespectful!

He lightly flipped his long-empty hand, and a treasured vase appeared.

This vase was only palm-sized, spotlessly white and radiating an intense, illusory light, yet the moment it appeared, it connected with the surrounding aura, spinning in mid-air as it swallowed the longsword whole.

Six Harmonies Treasured Vase!

Her spirit-linked sword-artifact having been swallowed, the woman's face paled, but her eyes brightened instantly as she spoke in a low voice,

"Fellow Daoist Yang!"

But the person hiding in the shadows attacked even faster than she could speak; the very instant the treasured vase appeared, a massive bronze cauldron materialized from nothing and suppressed it with a rumble, landing squarely on top of the jade vase!

In the sky stood a man in black robes, his expression solemn, his eyes complex, hinting at a deep hesitation and struggle.

Yang Ruiyi!

Perhaps it was because that Song Emperor's ambition was simply too strong that he was forced to make a move, or perhaps it was the promise Li Zhouwei had made to the Emperor back then—of raising immortals and seeking the Dao—that had moved his heart. This member of the Yang family had been deeply conflicted, but ultimately, between the Underworld's detached inclinations and the Emperor's command, he had chosen the latter!

This fragile balance was finally broken by him, exposing the blue-robed man, yet the Great General merely placed his hand silently on the hilt of his sword, positioning himself in front of the refined middle-aged man.

But that momentary opportunity was enough!

Between Han Ling's slender hands, an object lit up; it was bright as the moon, yet had the appearance of a talisman, shimmering with bright silver osmanthus patterns.

‘The Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman!’

‘The Han Clan's 【Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman】!’

Although she was not a Supreme Yin cultivator, the Celestial Wall Moon Radiance Profound Body granted by her Three Yin bloodline had ultimately allowed her to grasp the marvels of this Spiritual Treasure. Her figure moved like a gust of wind, passing straight through Changxiao as her slender, shimmering hand reached for Su Yan.

But Changxiao moved as well.

His prized treasured vase had been suppressed, yet he showed no sign of annoyance, his eyes filled with calm, as if he had already anticipated Yang Ruiyi's attack; his sleeve suddenly opened wide, a divine ability shining like a separate world, intent on temporarily trapping Han Ling!

His Upper Rite Dao was not one of slaughter, but when it came to defense and dealing with enemies, it far surpassed this weak Mansion Water Dao and the wavering Yang Ruiyi!

But before a smile could form on his face, astonishment flickered in Changxiao's eyes.

The sleeve that should have opened wide suddenly constricted, as if bound by something invisible; the cuff locked tightly around his wrist, and no matter how the sleeve itself swelled and struggled, it did not budge.

Man on Creek!

His gaze darkened as he instantly looked up toward a distant figure.

It was a middle-aged man.

His cultivation was only at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, yet he had been waiting here for a long time, his expression calm, one hand held to his chest, the other grasping forward as if holding an invisible fishing rod.

Changxiao recognized him.

‘The North Ring Sect... someone from the Xie family...’

If Li Quewan had been here, she would have recognized him too—this was the very same Daoist Master from the fight over the Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity!

‘He's never had any contact with me, nor could he possibly be using some pre-arranged gambit; Man on Creek shouldn't be able to lock down my divine ability this quickly...’

Xiao Chuting!

‘It's Xiao Chuting! He must have empowered this man's divine ability!’

‘He planted a piece in the North Ring Sect!’

He had no more time to think. Due to his spell art's interruption, Han Ling had only paused for a fraction of a second, and her slender hand was already descending.

Yet in that slight pause, the man before her had already raised his longsword, the Boundless Ocean once again resonating with the marvels within it—after these dozen or so breaths of empowerment, Su Yan's divine ability was stronger than before, and he managed to block her hand just in time.

Han Ling was not surprised; the osmanthus light on her brow brightened once more, her gaze turning frigid in an instant as she whispered,

"Edict!"

The silver disk floating behind Yan Jianxiao, which had been silently digesting the Spiritual Radiance Light of Supreme Yin, suddenly erupted with a bang. That very light rioted, surging out and faintly targeting Su Yan!

Concealment was an art of the Supreme Yin; Changxiao, unfamiliar with the Dao of the Three Yin, had been completely blindsided by this scheme!

Yan Jianxiao was taken by surprise, but he only sighed softly as a divine ability, held dormant for long, lit up once more.

King's Hunt.

A pale golden light rippled out, and when the divine ability settled, his face had transformed into Su Yan's. This 'youth' was slightly shorter than him, draped in the overly large feather cloak, and still holding the twelve-angled lantern.

And beneath the vast light of Supreme Yin was no longer the blue-robed youth, but Yan Jianxiao, his hands clasped together, holding that deep blue precious sword with a somber expression.

‘The Monarch opens the net on three sides, inviting the King to hunt the Profound Palace.’

This was why Yan Jianxiao had told him to stay within ten metres!

At the same time, a figure had already appeared on the nearby water surface; he was burly and solemn-faced, bobbing with the waves.

Wu Gao!

Wu Gao and Danyin had originally been intercepted by Chiguang, but when the treasures emerged, the three had scattered, ceasing their fight long ago to snatch treasures for themselves!

Danyin and Chiguang were naturally preoccupied, each fighting fiercely for their own gains, but Wu Gao was different.

This Great Daoist Master, in the end, possessed a pure heart. Out of a desire to repay Mount Changhuai, he had received an order and taken it to heart. Even with myriad treasures flashing before him, and even though he deeply disliked Qing Jifang who gave the order, at this critical moment, he ultimately followed his conscience and stepped forward.

Simultaneously, a grey shadow burst from the water's surface with perfect timing, lashing toward Su Yan.

The long rope was a dull, dark color, covered in dense, golden, mountain-like patterns; it leaped up like a venomous snake, as if it had just emerged from the clouds.

Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope!

The Spiritual Artifact that had once swept through Jianghuai, leaving the Li family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators helpless, had reappeared; full of spiritual energy, it wrapped around the youth's waist, its wondrous light flaring as it sought to pull him from danger and drag him to Wu Gao's side.

‘A pity...’

The light in Han Ling's eyes dimmed instantly, while Changxiao just stood there quietly, his eyes betraying no joy or sorrow, only calm.

He seemed to be waiting for something.

In the next instant, Han Ling's expression suddenly trembled.

The sky suddenly darkened.

Su Yan had not yet recovered from the successive dangers when everything before him plunged into darkness; all receded, the grotto-heaven and the divine abilities alike, leaving only a thick, incomparably dangerous blackness.

The long rope covered in mountain-like patterns was seized by an abrupt hand. The rope, like a mountain snake, thrashed violently, trying to break free, but it stood no chance, all its wondrous power seemingly crushed by that single grip!

‘Too fast!’

This great battle seemed intense, but it had all happened in the blink of an eye. Everyone present was a peak divine ability expert of the mortal world, and the entire exchange had not even lasted one hundred breaths! Even if Su Yan could borrow a fraction of their power, the difference in Dao-Profundity and divine ability made it impossible for him to keep up with the changes!

Until golden pupils flickered before Su Yan's eyes.

‘Li Zhouwei!’

Su Yan knew him all too well; everyone in Jiangnan knew him. This King Wei was not a Great Daoist Master, yet he surpassed one!

Those same three words also sounded as the darkness fell, murmured from another's lips.

Changxiao.

He was not surprised; that refined face was filled with understanding, even a placid calm.

‘Ever since the matter with Li Ximing, I knew you Li family members had unnatural perception—Li Zhouwei! You knew I was here all along! You were waiting, waiting for all the pieces to be in place before you made your move! You were bound to appear at this exact moment!’

The spot between his brows suddenly lit up as the wondrous divine ability he had specially prepared began to operate.

King's Hunt.

‘The Palace is empty, fortunately the Monarch only waits.’

The twelve-angled palace lantern in Su Yan's hand, which had been waiting, flashed brightly, and Changxiao once again passed through the two, his figure striding out, escaping from between the two Great Daoist Masters and arriving within this dim, dark world.

Such skill—the feather cloak and the dharma lamp both returned to him!

But when he raised his head, shock and stagnation finally appeared in the Great Daoist Master's eyes.

Within a massive sunset, black robes billowing in the wind, a man stood quietly in the sky, gazing at him. Behind him, the Bright Yang divine ability, like a pillar supporting the heavens, bloomed with an aura of supreme prosperity.

‘A Great Daoist Master...’

‘He... has stepped past the Purple Mystery.’

‘Such... talent...’

This fourth divine ability completely shattered his plans. All of Changxiao's calculations and schemes, like a tower with its foundation removed, came crashing down, and as he stood frozen in shock, the King Wei before him slowly took a step back.

In an instant, a tall Profound Gate boomed, and layer upon layer of palace chambers unfolded before them. Gold-armored figures flickered past their vision like shadows, and as if falling into a bottomless abyss, their sight spun, dark, gold-patterned palace doors opening one after another, as if this imperial palace were endless!

It seemed to last an eternity, yet condensed into a single instant; the final palace door opened, revealing an imperial sovereign high on his throne in a magnificent, seemingly endless hall, where profound pillars reached the heavens, and the sound of deafening cheers and worship filled their ears.

Su Yan's cultivation was too low; he was instantly stunned and unable to move, about to be absorbed by the divine ability, but Yan Jianxiao stood quietly in front of him, looking up, gazing at the endlessly magnificent hall and the towering Celestial Gate.

He was completely unafraid.

As one also from the Encompassing Profundity Daoist Tradition, he had heard of the Imperial Observation of the Origin. This divine ability was exceedingly strange, claiming that within it, one was the focus of all under heaven, and Li Zhouwei would surely be greatly empowered within.

And he, Li Zhouwei, could not be defeated in this great hall.

‘If you want to take Su Yan, you cannot avoid me. But, Li Zhouwei—what will you use to defeat me? A newly mastered divine ability?’

In such a short time, not even someone at the perfection stage of the divine ability realm would dare claim they could quickly defeat him, Yan Jianxiao!

But as Daoist Master Changxiao's smiling gaze swept past the high imperial throne and fell upon the vast, ever-expanding hall, his eyes suddenly froze, his pupils reflecting another figure.

Clad in green robes, he was an abrupt presence, standing on the third step below the imperial throne with his hands clasped behind him. He had just revealed himself from behind the great hall, having waited for who knows how long, and now he turned slowly, revealing a handsome face.

His pair of jade-green eyes were bright, his lips curved in a demonic smile, and ink beads rested in his hand, rolling in his palm like water droplets, his narrow eyes filled with a lazy, scattered air.

This was someone Changxiao had never expected to see.

Chi Buzi.

‘The green-eyed devil...’

‘How can it be him... wasn't he... supposed to be holding back Murong Weidian?!’

Yan Jianxiao couldn't spare a thought for that; he understood only one thing clearly.

‘With Chi Buzi and Li Zhouwei attacking at the same time...’

‘I have at least a seventy percent chance of dying right here!’

In that instant, the Great Daoist Master finally felt the urge to retreat. His experiences surviving life-and-death situations in the Eastern Sea had made him incredibly decisive, and his Dao-Profundity and divine abilities were so high that even when facing this technique, he still had the means to escape!

‘Escape!’

Unexpectedly, the moment he activated his divine ability, the technique pulling at him suddenly went slack, snapping like a flimsy cotton thread in the blink of an eye.

‘Not good!’

‘Too easy! That's the Imperial Observation of the Origin!’

Yan Jianxiao didn't believe the current Li Zhouwei could defeat him, but he had never underestimated the King Wei!

He snapped his head up, but it was all over in an instant. As Yan Jianxiao's form contracted, the very second his foot left the great hall, the green-robed man smiled, his lips moving as he spoke three words.

Chou-Gui Hidden Form.

A wondrous green light spread.

This Pristine Water divine ability didn't touch Yan Jianxiao at all, but landed instead on Su Yan.

‘He’ had hidden the distance between the Imperial Observation of the Origin and Su Yan by thirty-one feet.

Daoist Master Su, who had been protected behind Changxiao this whole time, was thus caught off guard and stepped into the great hall; Changxiao, meanwhile, watched from the darkness as the hall sped away, faintly seeing that 'Chi Buzi' exhaust his divine ability, shattering like a watery reflection and dissolving into a pool of Pristine Water as the great hall boomed shut, sealing everything within.

In an instant, all of it became just a golden speck of light on the dark horizon.

‘Pristine Water... Pristine Water...’

Changxiao's willow-leaf eyes narrowed, a trace of understanding flashing through them as the endless darkness receded from his side, only to reveal that the dense Mansion Water and heavy Exiled Qi had already surrounded him.

‘That's right, the ink beads were taken by Murong Weidian; they couldn't be in his hands.’

‘That was a reflection.’

‘A reflection that Chi Buzi had hidden in advance using Chou-Gui Hidden Form.’

Yan Jianxiao's gaze gradually brightened, seemingly unconcerned by the two divine abilities closing in, nor bothered by his prior mistake. Even if his King's Hunt could respond, with his plans completely disrupted, he would never bet his own life on someone else's Dao-accomplishment!

With his cautious nature, he would have held back, even if this happened ten thousand times over.

He couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, ‘Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! It seems I was outplayed by a single move!’
