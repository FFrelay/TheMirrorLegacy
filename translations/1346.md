# Chapter 1346: Persuasion

The sky was dark and heavy.

Several streaks of flowing light raced across the skies, descending through the heavy layers of dark mist toward the land where ethereal mists drifted. Voices whispered from the side, with faint sounds of dispute mixed in.

Someone spoke, "Everyone... for us to escape so easily while leaving Daoist Master Gu isolated and without aid... I fear this is not the proper way to conduct oneself!"

Another voice sounded slightly guilty as it replied,

"Daoist Master Gu stayed behind to cover our retreat, blocking King Wei and paying the price of the two Passes so we could escape. If we were to linger casually, that would truly be failing his good intentions..."

Pang Yi trod upon golden light, his expression calm. As the cultivator guarding the two Passes, having suffered such a great defeat and surrendering the passes, he showed neither urgency nor anger, only smiling.

"It matters not! Daoist Master Gu will be fine."

He spoke as if enumerating family valuables.

"Daoist Master Gu has a resolute and decisive nature, and he places great importance on the unity of Gu Prefecture; he will never bow his head easily. The various lords allowed him to go out and guard a pass, and since he cultivates Converging Water, his path forward is cut off. If he is not fierce, he cannot contend with the dragon. With that Azure Profundity technique, 'Prophecy at Hand', is it possible he cannot escape?"

"Even in the worst case, if he fights to the end, King Wei loves talent—how could he easily kill him!"

Pang Yi gave a faint smile and added,

"Once Daoist Master Gu falls, can the current Shen Qiang lineage and the Longkang clan simply let the matter rest?"

The group knew this well in their hearts, but they needed someone of his noble status and command to step forward and say it. Thus, they followed him down. Pang Yi then assigned people to guard various spots, while the rest waited in the mountains for Longkang Yao. After all, no one actually felt that this Great Daoist Master would be unable to escape.

As for himself, he passed through the layers of mountain ranges surrounding the small city and descended toward the ancient town with extreme speed. He did not look around much, hurriedly heading west, and soon saw that lake. His old father had already risen on the wind, coming to welcome him with a mix of shock and worry.

Pang Queyun and Pang Yi were father and son, and they looked extremely alike—one old, one young, as if carved from the same mold. When their two pairs of beady eyes met, they smiled and headed inside.

The old father sent a mental message, 'Did Gu You manage to escape?'

'I do not know.'

The young man rode the wind forward, his demeanor composed, his spiritual sense moving secretly as he replied,

'Bright Yang is putting on quite a show. Is there any news from inside the grotto-heaven?'

'What news could there be? Old Man Qu shrank back into the grotto-heaven himself, clamoring about reporting to Miaofan, acting as if his mind is not on this matter at all, completely absolving himself of responsibility. The others remain stubborn. In my view, even if the news of the Great Defeat at the two passes arrives, it will be hard to change their minds.'

'Excellent. Let them fight it out.'

The old man and the young one, harboring ulterior motives, went inside. The young man judged,

'As long as Longkang Yao does not make a move, there will be people willing to charge to the front lines. The grotto-heavens have plenty of ways to leverage favors and connections. What I fear is that Gu You has been captured, which would tie the Great Daoist Master's hands.'

Within the Grotto-heaven, there were stubborn factions and factions that favored surrendering to Wei. The Pang clan had received a hint from Qu Caotan and knew that neither side was to be trifled with, so they stood with neither. Speaking of which, they did not feel much regret. Pang Queyun smiled, shaking his head, and said,

"Look, who has come?"

The two then went inside together and discovered a person standing by the lake. He was holding a scroll and standing quietly under the moonlight. Pang Yi looked closely and hurried forward, exclaiming with delight,

"Brother Fu!"

The man was extremely tall with slightly deep-set eyes and a stern appearance. Hearing this, he smiled and came forward to greet them as well, saying,

“Fellow Daoist Pang, it has been many years!”

Pang Yi shook his head repeatedly, "It has truly been many years. Ever since your father attained the Dao within the grotto-heaven, and took you along to that fine place to enjoy good fortune, we old playmates were tossed aside by you!"

These words were half-teasing, causing the young man to shake his head and laugh, correcting him,

"Brother Pang speaks too heavily..."

Pang Queyun stood beside them, chuckling cheerfully, though the hand clasped behind his back tapped his other wrist with some agitation.

This person was named Fu He, and his talent was indeed decent.

In the past, when the Tongxuan Palace was established, Shangguan Zidu taught the affairs of immortals to the world. Consequently, the Daoist Tradition of the Tongxuan Palace became the most widespread. Among them, the Two Lus were famous, yet they never attained the Dao. They had a junior brother named Chi Xiong, and the Fu clan were merely descendants of one of this man’s disciples.

Chi Xiong's surname was Wen, and he was the ancestor of that old Daoist Master Wen who had been so thoroughly beaten by King Wei that he couldn’t see the light of day. In other words, the Fu clan was merely on the level of the Jia and Wei. Upon seeing Wen Daoping, they ought to bow their heads. They originally had no qualifications to discuss the Dao with them.

'But you can’t argue with him having a good father who went to Dongmu Heaven to cultivate! Although Fu Tanjian is only an in-name disciple under the seat, and his qi flow has already been severed...'

But no matter what, he had listened to the teachings in front of the master!

In ancient times, the master-disciple lineage was paramount. Not a single disciple taught by the Three Profoundities Masters was below the rank of True Monarch, and nearly half of the disciples of these True Monarchs who had personally witnessed the profound were confident in forming their core... Although the standards were more lenient now, to put it impolitely, even if a dog had listened to the teachings before a True Monarch, they would still have to address it as ‘Lord’! How could the Fu clan's status not rise with the tide?

Fu He chatted warmly with Pang Yi. They sat down together, and after a brief exchange of pleasantries, the conversation naturally turned to the surrounding war.

Pang Yi sighed with emotion, "We did our utmost to block him, but alas, Bright Yang's momentum is already unstoppable... He broke through several passes in a row, and even Lord Longkang could do nothing against him!"

Fu He frowned and said indifferently, "II came today precisely to speak of this matter. You say Bright Yang's momentum is unstoppable,, but I see it differently. Lord Longkang's ability is not beneath my father's. If he truly committed to defending a location and tyring someone down, how many people in the world would not find it a headache? I heard in the grotto-heaven that they suspect Daoist Master Longkang did not do his utmost!"

Pang Yi, who never offended anyone, simply said in a solemn voice, “Absolutely impossible!”

As these words fell, a raging fire was already speeding toward them. It flashed only once in the sky before arriving in front of them in an instant. The Blazing Fire Great Daoist Master manifested, his aura fluctuating, his face looking slightly gloomy.

It was precisely Longkang Yao!

This Great Daoist Master had escaped from that sky full of Exiled Qi without sustaining the slightest injury. He stood by the lake like a Divine Envoy of Parched Earth, radiating waves of scorching heat that caused the three men to rise in unison and bow.

"Greetings, my Lord!"

Longkang Yao's face, usually as calm as an ancient well, was now infinitely gloomy. Back when he was narrowly defeated by Li Zhouwei in the East, although he regretted underestimating his enemy, he still had the mind to fight and win the next time they met, without much emotional turmoil. Now, however, he was like a suppressed volcano, seemingly ready to devour the people before him at any moment!

"Where is Gu You!"

This question was like a thunderclap, causing Pang Yi to tremble. He exchanged a glance with his father. Both father and son knew that since this Great Daoist Master had not returned, in nine out of ten cases, he had been captured by that King Wei!

Pang Yi said with guilt, "Daoist Master Gu... is at the two passes, bringing up the rear!"

Longkang Yao's gaze was like a sharp sword, piercing his face. His anger grew even more intense, but fortunately, Pang Yi was well-prepared. He wept and said,

"It is not that this junior did not try to persuade him... but Daoist Master Gu held his ground, simultaneously mocking Bian Qi, ridiculing Donghua, belittling Bright Yang, and ignoring the Purple Qi, claiming it couldn't harm him in the slightest. He even issued orders for the various cultivators to flee through the east gate..."

"Pang Yi is but a junior. How could I have argued with a Great Daoist Master? As he went far away, this junior was also burdened with the heavy responsibility of all the clans. Lacking his powerful divine abilities, how could I have sent the cultivators forward!"

Longkang Yao felt a suffocation in his chest hearing this—he knew best what kind of person Gu You was. These words sounded too much like something he would personally say. He gritted his teeth slightly, his inner anger suddenly finding no outlet.

'How many times have I mentioned it to him? Life-mandate comes first, Daoist ambition second. He stubbornly refuses to change...'

Yet, Longkang Yao had promoted him all this time precisely because he admired his character. Gu You's ability to cultivate Converging Water with a human body and easily break Purple Mystery was also because his ambitions were far-reaching and his Dao Heart was firm. Unfortunately, fortune and disaster were intertwined. At this moment, Longkang Yao actually felt regret.

'Everyone says that the two Daos of Merging and Converging are similar. As expected, this Merging Fire is foolish and greedy, and while Converging Water is somewhat better, it is occupied by that flavor of stubborn madness. He... is truly exactly the same as that sect in the sea, from top to bottom...'

Back then, the True Hornless Dragon, at the peak of the Dao Embryo realm, was able to unhesitatingly abandon everything for the sake of a single prophecy and engage in a life-and-death struggle with Pristine Water. Whether it was her or her dragon descendants, they were all first-class in their stubborn madness, which was a clear testament to the nature of Converging Water!

But his regret came too late. Gu You had been stationed at the two passes, the least likely place to be lost, and it was the last territory to fall. When the order came, he had even thanked Qu Caotan, but alas, the situation had changed so drastically...

As his expression shifted grimly, Fu He, who had been standing to the side, finally stepped forward and said with a smile.

"This junior has come to resolve the Great Daoist Master's difficulties!"

Longkang Yao naturally recognized him.

However, the Great Daoist Master did not give him a pleasant look. He walked slowly into the pavilion and sat down with composure, saying indifferently,

"Do you represent the Fu clan, or do you represent... Dongmu?"

This sentence terrified the young man. He bowed and said,

"How would this junior dare to represent Dongmu! Even my father is but an in-name disciple; he likewise would not dare to represent Dongmu! This junior is a member of Gu Prefecture and, by a stroke of luck, has some insight. I am merely offering a plan for the Great Daoist Master!"

Longkang Yao's expression then softened, and he said, "Speak."

Fu He then smiled and said, "Does the Daoist Master know... what that Li Zhouwei... has come for?"

Pang Yi watched coldly from the side, sneering in his heart,

'What else could it be... naturally, he came for the people...'

Longkang Yao laughed coldly, "Speak plainly."

Fu He stiffened inside, secretly gritting his teeth. But compared to status and position, even his father cultivating in the grotto-heaven could not be presumptuous before this one. He had no choice but to say:

“What he wants are people… Every time we fight a major battle, we lose, and he gains. We neither dare to force those who have surrendered to their deaths, nor do we have the ability to eliminate him. With him growing stronger as we weaken, this is a path to self-destruction. Since that is the case… what are we even fighting for?”

His words caused them to frown. They listened as Fu He continued,

"In this junior's humble opinion, the key to breaking this deadlock lies in taking the people back from under Bright Yang’s command. He wants people, not land. As long as we do not surrender to him, or surrender and then rebel... if there are enough capable people, he cannot possibly kill them all clean. If he kills them all clean, who will he find to be his arms and legs?"

"When that time comes... we will have the qualifications to negotiate with him..."

He continued immediately, "The grotto-heaven originally had this idea as well. But the problem is that the noble clans of Gu Prefecture are numerous, and their hearts cannot be united. At that time, a full three Great Daoist Masters were standing guard. With three people encircling him, even if they couldn't suppress the Qilin, they had the ability to force him to retreat... Why did it end up in this state? First, the command was not unified; second, there were no means to make those people cast themselves back to us..."

The young man knelt on the ground and said calmly,

"Great Daoist Master, forgive this junior for speaking bluntly. While the Longkang clan are certainly descendants of immortals, they have been hidden from the world for many years. Although the various divine abilities obey orders, they hesitate, wondering if one day your Lordship will return to the grotto-heaven, leaving only them inside Gu Prefecture..."

Longkang Yao's expression changed. He looked up at him, his lips moving, but he did not speak. Fu He said in a low voice,

"Now that King Wei is pressing west, he will inevitably attack Chun City to test the waters. My father's qi flow has been cut off. As long as the Great Daoist Master is willing to write a letter, this junior will immediately take it into the grotto-heaven and invite my father out!"

"His elderly self possesses extremely strong divine abilities and enjoys the favor of immortal light. He can both preserve the dignity of Gu Prefecture… and can step forward on the Great Daoist Master’s behalf, so you do not have to charge into the fray yourself and take all the karmic consequences upon the Longkang clan!"

His words seemed to have been prepared in advance, striking right at this Great Daoist Master’s point of hesitation. Longkang Yao was originally fearless, but the matter with Gu You had made him reflect, and this was precisely a moment of indecision.

Seeing the Great Daoist Master hesitate, Fu He knelt on the ground and gritted his teeth, saying,

"The Great Daoist Master has always seen clearly. We do not have the ability to kill him, but we have the foundation of autonomy. The grotto-heavens and secret realms stand lofty and high. Which of our ancestors was not an Immortal who attained the Dao, a True Monarch in their own right? Why must we sacrifice our own dignity to fulfill his ambitions?”

"After all… in the end, he is only one person, not an entire Daoist tradition. As long as we are of one mind and unwilling to bow our heads, no matter how great the loss, we can drive him out…"

He lowered his head as if he had steeled his heart, transmitting via spiritual consciousness,

"The Great Daoist Master is certainly of noble status, but the various cultivators may not be. This junior does not wish for the conflict between Blazing Fire and Bright Yang to ravage Gu Prefecture, leading to the devastation of its people. To be selfish, if my father is invited back, Bright Yang will surely place the blame on Dongmu Heaven and not on everyone else. This is good for others and for ourselves. I implore the Great Daoist Master to reconsider!"

These words caused Longkang Yao to raise his head and look at him scrutinizingly. Fu He's expression was extremely sincere as he said,

"This junior naturally understands that there are many in the world today who are displeased with us and would use his hand to humiliate us. This sort of thing is not uncommon. For generations, haven’t we always endured it this way? Is there truly no room for maneuver? But didn’t Emperor Zhao also compromise back then?"

He lowered his brow, as if he had mentioned some taboo, causing Longkang Yao's expression to change slightly. The Pang father and son pretended not to hear. There was a moment of silence among them before Fu He spoke quickly,

"We do not need another Emperor Liang, nor is he qualified to be Emperor Liang. We want him to cooperate... We want him to be... A Fu Qiyan!"

The courtyard fell into instant silence.

'Using the past to explain the present, linking ring by ring, starting from the two angles of Longkang Yao and Gu Prefecture, and even citing Emperor Zhao who likely died not long after attaining the Dao—what wonderful rhetoric!'

Pang Yi felt a slight shock in his heart—he and this man were childhood playmates, and he absolutely did not believe such words came from his mouth. In this instant, this sharp member of the Pang family immediately realized there was someone else's shadow behind this!

But the father and son held to an attitude of self-preservation, watching coldly from the sidelines. Absolutely no one opened their mouth to remind or persuade this Great Daoist Master. In the silent courtyard, there was only the sound of Longkang Yao gently tapping the table.

Clearly, he was already moved.

Those eyes burning with blazing flames stared likewise at Fu He, yet he did not speak. Longkang Yao's pride made him unwilling to bow his head to Bright Yang, but likewise, he was unwilling to easily bow before Dongmu. More importantly...

'You, Fu He... father and son are running dogs for Dongmu; how could you persuade me with good words! Unless absolutely necessary, I cannot use this lightly.'

After a long silence, he was extremely tempted, yet unwilling to bow his head easily. He simply said indifferently,

"The great battle that day was not finished. For Li Zhouwei to suppress Gu You, he absolutely would not have escaped unscathed. If he comes rashly, I will certainly fight him again to probe his true strength. We will discuss other matters after that!"
