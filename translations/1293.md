# Chapter 1293: Observing the Origin

Li Jiangqian listened to his words, merely raising an eyebrow and smiling.

"Sister already relayed Senior's words to Father, but he entered secluded cultivation a year ago and has yet to emerge, so we do not know what arrangements he has made."

Tianhuo smiled and shook his head.

'Li Zhouwei is in seclusion and hasn't emerged?'

He might not know about others, but since this King Wei had conquered Luoxia, he was certain to come this time; given the White Qilin's temperament, how could he possibly miss such a grand event where the world's tides converged?

He also knew this prince was not as sincere as Li Quewan and that he would certainly get no answers from him, so he just clasped his hands behind his back, turned, and said with a smile,

"Whatever arrangements there are, they will be revealed in the Great Tomb River. Please!"

He extended a hand forward, gesturing for Li Jiangqian to proceed north with him. The golden-eyed youth's gaze flickered for an instant, and with a look of doubt, he said softly,

"From what Senior implies, this grotto-heaven is about to open immediately."

Tianhuo glanced at him and said, "Daoist Master Xiao has already crossed the Jianghuai. By my calculations, at his slowest, it's a journey of several days; if he's fast, he could arrive in an instant. You and I both possess divine abilities; standing in the mountains for a few days is but the snap of a finger."

Li Jiangqian's heart shook.

He clearly remembered his father and Daoist Master Xiao had agreed on a four-year timeframe, yet it was only the third year. Calculating the dates, this was indeed far too early!

He hesitated for a moment, but Tianhuo was watching him quietly, his gaze sharp, and he smiled.

"Changli, are you... waiting for a particular Fellow Daoist?"

Tianhuo was no simple fool. Li Jiangqian had only asked one extra question, and Tianhuo immediately sensed something. The young man, however, kept his expression natural, shook his head gravely, and sighed.

"Not exactly. An opportunity like this should be a shared grand event, but unfortunately, my sister is at home cultivating a secret technique and finds it inconvenient to travel. That's why I came north in advance to observe the situation... I just didn't expect it to happen so quickly!"

He brazenly crushed the jade talisman in his sleeve, while Tianhuo frowned inwardly.

'A secret technique... yes... it must be the Profound Foundation on his lake...'

Although the Li family's effort to refine the Profound Foundation wasn't widely publicized, mobilizing hundreds or even thousands of cultivators was something that naturally couldn't be concealed. The major powers were all well aware of it. Tianhuo nodded and said,

"This is also a problem. With several Daoist Masters entering the grotto-heaven, the lake will inevitably be left undefended."

His words were no exaggeration. Qing Jifeng acted on whims and was an unstable variable. It was entirely possible that this Great General of Western Shu might suddenly change his mind, abandon the Great Tomb River, and turn his attention to the lake instead!

Therefore, with the opening of the Great Tomb River, several of the Li family's subordinate Daoist Masters, and even Li Ximing himself, had no choice but to remain at the lake.

'The Great Tomb River is filled with many divine abilities and is extremely dangerous. Quewan and I have the Spirit Probe for protection, allowing us to not only avoid danger but also to seek out opportunities. With just the two of us, it will be easier to rely on the protection of the Great Song's faction...'

Meanwhile, Cui Jueyin and the others had only just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, so their divine abilities were still shallow. Furthermore, Cheng Qian had to wait for Li Quewan to be available in order to stabilize the unfinished Profound Foundation, leaving him unable to move. Li Ximing, by remaining at the lake, could likewise rely on the Spirit Probe to detect any offensive from Western Shu.

This had been arranged between Li Jiangqian and Li Ximing before he set out. Although a variable had suddenly appeared, he did not seem flustered.

'There's just no time to leave and come back again!'

His thoughts were very clear.

'In front of the Great Tomb River, with the Yang family present, no one will dare to harm me publicly. But once the grotto-heaven opens, there will inevitably be turmoil both inside and out. Within the grotto-heaven, I can move freely. However, if I return to the lake and miss the window, and Yang Ruiyi and the others have already entered the Great Tomb River, I would surely be intercepted by Buddhist cultivators at Luoxia if I then tried to travel to Huan Prefecture.'

Although Li Quewan possessed a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, it could only bless one additional person, and it would likely be used to assist Li Zhouwei. He didn't even consider it.

'Since that's the case, there are only two paths. Either enter the grotto-heaven now with the divine abilities of the Great Song, or return to the lake, hide, and obediently miss this opportunity.'

As for the Great Tomb River, the Li siblings absolutely had to go. Judging from Li Zhouwei's experience in Wanling Heaven, possessing the Talisman Seed made the two of them the ideal candidates to enter the grotto-heaven. One more person meant one more share of the rewards...

'Besides... I really need to achieve something!'

Li Zhouwei's support for the entire Li family was self-evident. If not for the King Wei, the family's current savings wouldn't be even a tenth of what they were. Li Jiangqian knew perfectly well how much nourishment he had received since achieving his divine ability.

When Li Jiangqian was in the Foundation Establishment Realm, he managed the entire Li family in perfect order, but things were different now. Li Quewan had made great contributions by transforming resources and constructing the Profound Foundation. He, Li Jiangqian, to put it bluntly, had yet to achieve a single shred of merit. In his view, this was by no means a sustainable path.

'When Father had two divine abilities, he ventured into Wanling Heaven and seized the family's first Spiritual Treasure. Now I also have two divine abilities, and the Great Tomb River is right before me!'

He prided himself on being a dragon among men, and the son of a Qilin at that. How could he be reconciled if he failed to seize an opportunity or two?

Besides, his family members were not thoughtless. Li Jiangqian didn't need any more reminding and made his decision in an instant. With a worried sigh, he said,

"Very well... please."

Tianhuo nodded with a smile, not at all concerned that the two of them belonged to different nations, and flew forward on the wind with him. Nearby, Tantai Jin bowed, bid his farewell, and returned south. Tianhuo glanced at his retreating back before speaking.

"That must be a Daoist Master from the Tantai family..."

Li Jiangqian nodded, only to see Tianhuo shake his head with a look of extreme pity.

"I heard that an ancestor of the Tantai family had some connection with the lord of my Golden Oneness back then and could even be considered a friend. Before the Wei Dynasty was established, my lord advised him to establish his Daoist Tradition on the mainland, but he firmly refused..."

"What a pity. A great clan from ancient times, once as famous as the Han Family of Yuanxia, which cultivated the Three Yin for generations, has now fallen to such obscurity. They finally produced a Daoist Master, only for him to cultivate 'Blazing Fire'."

Li Jiangqian shook his head and said, "Isn't there still Daoist Master Yuandao? I heard he is also a great cultivator!"

Tianhuo sighed and shook his head, seemingly in disagreement, but said no more. As the mountains and rivers below gradually came into view, the two parted ways. Li Jiangqian descended on his side and waited a short while. Sure enough, he saw Sima Yuanli approaching on a cloud, dressed in green robes, with a gloomy-faced Yu Xi beside him.

This Daoist Master Qinghu had arrived in a hurry. He looked around, his scalp tingling with apprehension. When he finally saw Li Jiangqian, his eyes lit up, and he hurriedly bowed.

"Daoist Master Changli!"

He scanned the area carefully, a hesitant look appearing on his face. Yu Xi was more direct; the old man seemed even more pressed for time these years, and his complexion looked much worse. He stepped forward, cupped his hands, and asked,

"Might I ask... where is King Wei?"

It was no wonder they asked. The sky above the Great Tomb River was currently roiling with divine abilities. The great cultivators from several Daoist Traditions had all arrived, and every single one standing in the sky possessed immeasurable divine might!

Yang Ruiyi had his usual Underworld temperament, refusing to show himself until a fight broke out, remaining silently hidden in the Great Void, leaving others unable to track him. Li Jiangqian, possessing the Spirit Probe, could see him clearly, but these two couldn't be sure...

Thinking it over, they actually started to miss Li Zhouwei's presence. After all, the King Wei was an existence comparable to a Great Daoist Master. Having that White Qilin of the mortal world stand at the front lines was far more reassuring.

Li Jiangqian could see what they were thinking and smiled inwardly, but he just sighed and shook his head. Seeing Yu Xi look as if he wanted to speak but held back, Sima Yuanli guessed that Li Zhouwei and Yang Ruiyi had some other plan that wasn't convenient to discuss, so he just said,

"I asked Fellow Daoist Yang. She was ordered to invite Daoist Master Yehui to Jianghuai, and Daoist Master Changyun has already reached Liangchuan..."

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian's heart stirred.

'Changyun... Yehui...'

Evidently, these two Daoist Masters didn't have a deep connection to the Water Virtue, so they were left behind in Luoxia by the Yang clan. Yu Xi, however, was a Valley Water cultivator, so he absolutely had to come this time. Who knows what concessions he had to make to the Yang family.

Li Jiangqian simply said, "Father and Lord Yang perhaps made arrangements long ago. I am currently unaware of his whereabouts. If time runs out, I'm afraid we will have to enter first."

Sima Yuanli nodded thoughtfully, but then he saw wind and snow rolling in the distance. A sheet of clear, bright light sped over from the river, manifesting a person before them. He was clad in fluttering white robes, steering the Mansion Water, looking utterly dashing.

When Sima Yuanli saw him, the great stone in his heart finally fell, and he let out a sigh of relief. He stepped forward to get a better look and said,

"Fellow Daoist Guanghou!"

'Daoist Master Guanghou?'

Li Jiangqian's heart stirred, and Yu Xi, beside him, had a look of outright shock.

'The Pure Unity Dao Gate! They've submitted to the Song...'

In the sky, not a few of the divine abilities turned their gaze toward them, communicating amongst themselves while maintaining an eerie silence. Guanghou, however, reluctantly gave Sima Yuanli some face and nodded casually.

He merely turned his head to the side, looked at Li Jiangqian, and said softly, "You must be the Young Lord. I am Guanghou."

Before Li Jiangqian could speak, the sky suddenly darkened. A wild wind howled through the mountains. The two figures who had been in a standoff on the mountaintop finally moved their gazes. Daoist Master Qu drained the clear wine from his golden goblet in one gulp and straightened his sleeves. The monk in black robes stood up, his gaze fixed on the far distance.

Amidst the ethereal clouds and mist, a colossal golden body slowly moved its giant head, casting an immense shadow upon the ground. The roiling clouds of Valley Water ceased their movement, and a long-haired man stepped out from the void. From the southern horizon, crimson flames surged as True Fire approached.

As if in an instant, the sky full of Immortals and Buddhists, who had been like a painted backdrop, all came to life. Their divine abilities surged, and gazes—envious, vicious, pitying, or cold—all focused on the southeast. Upon the fertile plains, amidst the whistling wind and rain, a tiny, brownish-green figure was steadily growing larger.

It was still the same straw raincoat, like that of a mortal, and still the same old man with a calm expression. His emerald-green fishing rod swayed gently in the rain.

Xiao Chuting.

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Lunar brilliance flowed and shone, illuminating the world with radiance. Streams of spiritual light shone, like currents of molten gold, converging from all directions.

Upon a stone platform in the pavilion sat a figure, upright and noble in black robes embroidered with gold. Hues of Bright Yang light illuminated his chiseled features, glittering with a mesmerizing, soul-stirring splendor.

These streams of incomparably dense spiritual energy converged within him, flowing through his body into his sea of qi, condensing into the dharma power of his divine abilities, and ascending to the Shengyang Acupoint!

Within this Shengyang Acupoint, hues of light intertwined. The Celestial Gate towered, boundlessly noble; a Qilin leaped, filled with infinite killing intent; a vast, boundless crimson sunset lingered; all entangled with one another. In the very center, a brilliant Heavenly Light pulsed, subtly weighing down a white pearl that shone as bright as the moon.

Above these three divine abilities, a bright radiance suddenly plummeted, like a peerless, noble emperor intending to suppress his court, provoking the Qilin's defiance and the Celestial Gate's fury, causing a heavenly uproar!

Li Zhouwei had long since raised the Imperial Observation of the Origin into his Shengyang Acupoint and had experienced the power of this Purple Mystery immortal threshold before. Yet only when he truly elevated Imperial Observation of the Origin into the Shengyang Acupoint and tried to stabilize the divine ability did he comprehend the sheer difficulty involved.

'Over the past two years, after taking the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill, Imperial Observation of the Origin has reached completion. Upon being suddenly elevated, it has transformed into a divine ability within the Shengyang Acupoint, yet it remains incompatible with the three original Bright Yang divine abilities, making it difficult to integrate...'

With his level of Dao-Profundity, he focused all his effort on reconciliation, forcibly suppressing the Crimson Severing Arrowhead. There were countless setbacks during this period; at times the Celestial Gate grew restless, at others the Qilin grew uneasy. Even the Imperial Observation of the Origin in the sky continued to struggle, attempting to descend prematurely.

'This is the moment that tests my Dao-Profundity!'

At this moment, Li Zhouwei not only needed an extremely deep understanding of these four divine abilities, but he also had to be able to resolve the various entanglements between them, comprehending every transformation. A single careless mistake would mean all his previous efforts were wasted.

'No wonder.'

Li Zhouwei did not know how other Dao lineages handled this, but at least for the Bright Yang, for his breakthrough, it was like this. It wasn't overly difficult; on the contrary, it gave him a sense of calm.

'This is... too easy. I was being overly cautious.'

He, Li Zhouwei, was born with a Bright Yang destiny and blessed by Talisman Qi. While he often appeared to rely on raw power to overwhelm opponents in battle, his actual Dao-Profundity was second to none in Jiangnan. Perhaps only the long-missing Daoist Master Zimu would dare claim to be first!

The Bright Yang destiny he shouldered, the entanglement of Metallic Essence, was like a strand of bright light tied to the neck of a Bright Yang stallion, and like a poisoned whip, forcibly driving his divine ability toward Fruition Attainment. It was just like that year he picked up the Primal Summit and spoke that sentence to Li Xuanxuan:

'The Bright Yang, by its very nature, loves me!'

Those words alone were, in fact, enough. The Purple Mystery was a limitation for ordinary men. How could it ever restrain a Qilin!

In merely two hundred days, he had forcefully suppressed the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' to the very bottom of the Shengyang Acupoint!

But as the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' sank into it, it became completely different. Under Li Zhouwei's intentional harmonization, this aspect of Bright Yang's shadow transformed into a vast desert, becoming the boundless landscape at the base of the Shengyang Acupoint. The Celestial Gate, the Qilin... and even the 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' with its imperial aura, which had taken the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead's' place between the Celestial Gate and the Qilin—all of it transformed into a profound scene upon the desert, splitting his Shengyang Acupoint into three parts!

A chill rushed from his Shengyang Acupoint into his mind, dispelling a patch of mist. The three divine abilities, already clear in his consciousness, finally welcomed the fourth radiance.

In that instant, the black-robed youth's eyes snapped open, the gold in his pupils flashing with a brilliant white. Violent Heavenly Light whipped his robes about, and dense, bright-golden Qilin markings crawled across his cheeks!

'Imperial Observation of the Origin'—achieved!

Scalding hues of Bright Yang lit up one by one behind him, forming concentric halos of colored light. The King Wei finally rose to his feet. He stretched out his hands; the Celestial Gate, the Imperial Garden, the Great Desert, and the Qilin—four divine abilities converged, merging into one.

The Bright Yang upon this White Qilin had progressed from a reversed, lightless state to the divine ability of the Perilous Tread, and then rose anew from the desert's setting sun. Now, it had finally reached the state of Bright Yang's rectification: the Imperial Observation of the Origin!

The color in his eyes was gold, flecked with white, shining brightly as the moon. His five fingers suddenly clenched, revealing taut, strong lines. The ink-black jade talisman in his grasp instantly shattered, turning into black sand that streamed from between his fingers.

'As of today, I am a Great Daoist Master of Bright Yang.'
