# Chapter 1: First Entry

Lu Jiangxian had a long, long dream. He dreamed of planting rice in the fields, dreamed of the glint and shadow of blades, dreamed of immortal sects, a woman, and a great lake.

"Surrender the Supreme Yin Breathing and Qi Refining Art and the Secret Annals of the Lunar Essence, and we shall only cripple your cultivation."

A voice, both pleasant and icy, rang in his ear; Lu Jiangxian vaguely glimpsed a hazy face, but he could not see it clearly.

...

"Clang!"

A violent jolt shocked Lu Jiangxian awake.

A phantasmagoria of colors surfaced in his mind; Lu Jiangxian tried to open his eyes, tried to get up, but his body, as if gripped by sleep paralysis, ignored his commands completely.

At that moment, a brilliant white light split the dense darkness before him; though the blackness surged in like a relentless tide, the pillar of light stood firm, as eternal and unchanging as the sun.

Countless golden runes burst forth from within it, unfurling in the darkness and scattering across the sky like stars.

'How beautiful,' Lu Jiangxian thought, stunned.

As the runes multiplied, seeming to reach some critical limit, he heard a sharp crack, like shattering glass.

The world... brightened.

Lu Jiangxian saw a sky as vast and blue as the ocean, a dense, boundless primeval forest, and, not far away, a small, crescent-shaped lake; in that direction, a streak of white light was falling into the glimmering water.

Below lay a small cluster of thatched-roof huts and stretches of rice paddies.

From his violently tumbling perspective, he felt like a weightless bird soaring past a small, ochre-colored village and its cooking fires, gliding over a clear river.

In that fleeting glimpse, Lu Jiangxian saw his own reflection in the river below.

'It seems to be something round... and sparkling,' Lu Jiangxian thought in confusion as a faint premonition surfaced in his mind:

'Am I not human anymore?'

"Splash!" The violent motion returned, and Lu Jiangxian plunged into the water; the river was too shallow to absorb the full impact, causing him to knock lightly against the gray stones of the riverbed.

The impact felt like a punch to the chest, leaving him feeling tight-chested and short of breath, yet his body used the churning water and the rebound force to steadily flip over, landing face-up, staring directly at the sun rippling on the river's surface.

'Wasn't I just pulling an all-nighter in my rented apartment, revising a proposal?'

Lu Jiangxian silently watched the sun on the water's surface; the current flowed swiftly, making the patterns of light on the riverbed twist and writhe.

As he quietly recalled the past, a sharp pain lanced through his head; he only remembered collapsing onto his bed in exhaustion, the stale smoke and the glow of neon lights drifting through his small apartment.

He had opened a beer, sat at his dim computer desk, and as a world-spinning dizziness overcame him, he felt his heart begin to race, his breathing growing difficult.

'I think... I died?'

'This is actually... pretty good. No need to worry about the future, no need to worry about life.'

Perhaps because he had been repressed for so long, this thought actually surfaced in his mind, and his mood even became somewhat cheerful.

He observed his surroundings: overhead were dark green treetops trailing aerial roots; occasionally, nimble fish darted past his face; and faintly, he could hear the tinkling sound of splashing water.

Lu Jiangxian sighed:

'But if this continues, I'll go mad from boredom.'

Thus, he stared blankly as the sun slowly slid from its zenith and a brilliant sunset crept across the sky, the stretch of water beneath the treetops gradually dimming.

During that time, two fish circled him curiously, and a crab even attempted to flip him over.

Not until the moon climbed above the treetops did clear, gentle moonlight drift onto the river's surface; Lu Jiangxian was thrilled to feel a cool energy seep down to the riverbed, bringing with it a faint sense of comfort.

Watching the moonlight gather bit by bit above his body, seemingly coming alive as it formed a pale white lunar halo, Lu Jiangxian was overcome with shock, his state of mind shifting dramatically.

'What is this? Am I absorbing the essence of the sun and moon? Are there really immortals in this world? Marvelous divine abilities? Demons? Ghosts and gods?' he thought, stunned. 'Then what have I become? An artifact spirit?'

A thread of curiosity and joy rose from deep within Lu Jiangxian; that wisp of lunar halo also seemed to have gathered enough power, and it drifted down upon him.

He merely felt a cool sensation spread over his body before sinking into a meditative state, as if half-asleep.

An unknown amount of time passed before the flow of energy grew thin, and Lu Jiangxian woke with a start; the crescent moon had already faded from the sky as the sun leaped above the treetops, scattering warm morning light across the river.

'So fast.'

Lu Jiangxian was overjoyed; sensing carefully, he found there was indeed a faint current of energy circulating within him, moving in a circle around his body's round edge.

Furthermore, when Lu Jiangxian focused his energy and sank his consciousness, he could vaguely perceive an ashen-gray mirror lying quietly on the riverbed, nestled upon colorful pebbles, while several fish foraged on the river bottom.

That river crab was digging in the mud nearby; his visible range was only about one meter, and the image was fuzzy, like an old, thick-headed television set from his childhood.

'This must be me now,' Lu Jiangxian thought with a wry smile, then he deliberately controlled the energy flow, guiding it to stagnate in the mirror's center; the ashen-gray mirror subsequently emitted a faint trace of light.

'Other than glowing, I haven't found any other use for it.'

'First, I'll focus on absorbing the lunar essence; perhaps there will be a qualitative change,' he planned silently. 'I don't know the mirror's material, nor how the outside world views sentient artifacts. I just hope I'm not discovered by some cultivator who casually erases my consciousness.'
