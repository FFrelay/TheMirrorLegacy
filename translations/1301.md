# Chapter 1301: Guanyuan

‘Someone is here?’

The two enormous golden bodies froze in the sky, and the tiny figure trapped between them like a pearl had just found an unexpected escape from certain doom. He was ecstatic. Sima Yuanli had never been so overjoyed by the appearance of a fellow Daoist. Spiritual sense was restricted here, so he immediately activated a divine ability, his voice vibrating outwards.

“Fellow Daoist, please save me!”

The words were consumed by the Buddhist light, echoing feebly amidst the churning rapids. Renshijia's figure suddenly erupted with boundless radiance. Streaks of crimson patterns surfaced on his Dharma Body, rapidly converging into the forms of jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards!

In an instant, a beam projecting all manner of colors leaped forth, streaking like a golden bolt of lightning through the heavy river water, pouncing toward the newcomer's face!

Renshijia was renowned as a Dharma Protector Maha of the Way of Great Desire, his status equal to that of the Earth-Governing Maha, Xiaodisa. Back when Sparrow Carp Fish had not yet emerged from seclusion, their positions were second only to Tian Langzhi; naturally, each possessed considerable abilities.

Renshijia himself possessed high Dao-comprehension. His golden-patterned body was integrated with all sorts of Immortal Dao treasures, a testament to his sincerity. Back when he was still a Merciful One, he had sought guidance from the various preeminent cultivators on Mount Dayang. Whether it was Jinlian or Beigu, he had discussed the Dao with all these cultivators who held profound attainments in the Immortal Dao.

Now, after countless years of refinement, its might was utterly terrifying. With his disciple-brother at his side, he naturally dared to scorn the White Qilin who was currently enjoying the spotlight!

Yet he still deemed it insufficient. His other golden hand was already striking down brazenly, smashing straight toward Sima Yuanli and his companion!

The Dharma Protector Maha's Buddhist light soared to the heavens, finally eclipsing the brilliant approaching radiance. He actually manifested a glittering Buddhist Land, where lotuses bloomed, temples rose like forests, and myriad colors flared, enveloping the figure within it.

Countless golden-lit halls appeared, incense smoke coiling unendingly, and candle wax flowed like waterfalls, spreading over dark, profound mountains. In the very center stood an enormous figure with the body of a jackal and the head of a wolf. Its fangs were bared, yet its face was compassionate. It sat upon the high seat, gazing down upon the ink-robed figure.

For a moment, it seemed as if ten thousand voices of anger rose, the glaring, wrathful golden bodies overlapping one upon another.

“Vile beast! Kneel…”

The sound had not yet finished booming through the air when the ink-robed youth vanished. The massive, jackal-bodied, wolf-headed figure’s lips had not even parted when a left fist, densely covered in golden patterns, appeared before its chin!

“Boom!”

Heavenly Light, dense to the extreme, poured out like a deluge. The gargantuan, illusory figure seemed to have been struck by a behemoth dozens of times its size. With the last half-syllable still caught in its mouth, its head snapped back, and shattering fissures spread across the entire jackal-wolf visage as it was blasted into the air!

Shattering along with it was the entire illusory Buddhist Land that spanned the sky!

Simultaneously, Renshijia spat out a mouthful of golden blood without warning. Fine cracks even appeared within his pupils. He raised his head in horror, his expression changing drastically!

The Buddhist Land that had spanned the river was gone.

The temples, the radiance, the sky full of lotuses, the ancient jackal-bodied Buddhist—all of it was drowned in an endless darkness. This darkness was far vaster than his Buddhist Land, spreading from the man's feet to engulf the two massive golden bodies.

In that instant, he felt as if he were not in this grotto-heaven surrounded by river water, but standing desolate upon a vast desert, and from within the infinite darkness, that calm gaze stabbed straight at him.

This King Wei did not speak, as if unconcerned, or perhaps disdainful. He had already ridden his divine ability to stand before him, the auroral flames of the power raging behind him as if to pierce the heavens. The pupils of Renshijia's massive Dharma Body were completely golden, reflecting another fist densely covered in golden patterns.

“Boom!”

Renshijia’s Dharma Body had been refined for seven hundred years. He often boasted, proudly calling it invulnerable, and it was indeed formidable. Yet, everything was utterly different from his expectations. In that moment, his mountain-heavy head seemed like fragile glass smashed against an incomparably sharp object. Fissures erupted all at once, layer upon layer, patch upon patch. Renshijia's vision seemed to ripple with countless colors, obscuring his sight.

The White Qilin's fist struck his brow, causing him to spurt another mouthful of hot golden blood as his disciple-brother's overly terrified voice rang in his ears,

“You... you...”

Equally stunned was Sima Yuanli, who stood frozen in the air.

‘King Wei!’

His heart thundered, unable to believe what he was seeing, his mind momentarily blank, leaving only three words.

‘Great Daoist Master...’

‘Great Daoist Master!’

Sima Yuanli and Li Zhouwei were of vastly different ages, yet they had broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm at around the same time. For decades, he had been diligent, yet he remained at the early Purple Mansion Realm. In the blink of an eye, Li Zhouwei was already a Great Daoist Master!

That was a Great Daoist Master! A divine ability beyond divine abilities... the lifelong aspiration of countless Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!

Attaining the Purple Mystery had always been a heavenly chasm. His own Daoist Master Yuanxiu was a prodigy himself, yet he had been stuck before this hurdle for untold years. Sima Yuanli had no doubt that Li Zhouwei would eventually cross it...

‘But it shouldn't be possible to achieve it in just two or three years, in the snap of a finger!’

‘Even if... he is Li Zhouwei... the White Qilin...’

The shock flooding his mind temporarily overshadowed even the joy of his desperate reprieve, leaving him standing in a daze.

On the other side, Xiaodisa’s heart sank to the abyss, filled with boundless panic and despair. The Buddhist light he was condensing to its peak was suddenly interrupted by the erupting Radiant Fire of the Southern Emperor Profound Snare:

‘A Great Daoist Master... Four divine abilities...’

‘The White Qilin with four divine abilities!’

The principle that he becomes stronger when the Bright Yang flourishes was clear to every cultivator in the north. Xiaodisa, of course, understood what it meant for the man before him to become a Great Daoist Master...

But of all places, it had to be here! Inside the grotto-heaven!

Renshijia and Xiaodisa had simultaneously lost their connection to the Buddhist Land. Not only could they receive no augmentation, but more importantly...

‘If we fall here, we will truly die with no burial place, with no chance of reincarnation!’

But time stops for no one. As Xiaodisa was scared witless, he only had time to utter two words before he saw the youth turn his head, his golden gaze like a sharp sword.

‘This is bitter fate!’

Li Zhouwei suddenly turned. The Grand Ascension instantly appeared in his empty hand, its curved, blade-like branch pulsing as the long halberd pierced the air. Xiaodisa raised the black urn in his hand high, circulating his Buddhist light to its absolute peak, his voice trembling,

“Wei... King Wei!”

The star-bright halberd thrust through, colliding thunderously with the black urn. The intense might of the divine ability forced Xiaodisa's golden body to sink. Having lost the augmentation from his Buddhist Land, he was actually suppressed.

And the ink-robed youth was holding the halberd with only one hand.

Xiaodisa had cultivated to this day and experienced countless battles. A Buddhist cultivator who survived so long naturally had excellent judgment. In this brief exchange, he had already seen the truth.

‘I can't stop him!’

‘Outside this grotto-heaven, it would be a different story; if we joined forces, we could create an opening. But inside here, we are only slightly stronger middle-stage Purple Mansion cultivators. He possessed such might even before his breakthrough. I wasn't even certain I could suppress him then, let alone now...’

At this thought, a chill still shot straight to his mind.

‘The question is... just how strong is he now!’

‘Forget the likes of Zhu Kui or Qiye; I fear even Changxiao and Chiguang might not be able to suppress him!’

Despair overflowed in Xiaodisa’s heart for an instant, before he suddenly felt the pressure on him lighten. The bright Buddhist Land stubbornly bloomed once more in this dim, boundless world. The massive jackal-bodied, wolf-headed figure reappeared, its voice filled with shock and rage,

“Disciple-Brother, I am here to help you!”

This jackal-bodied, wolf-headed phantom was, after all, the Great Dao of a Six-Generation Maha, refined for hundreds of years. It was one thing for it to manifest again after taking such a heavy blow, but it was even attempting to gain a foothold within the Crimson Severing Arrowhead!

Xiaodisa seemed to see a glimmer of hope for escape, joy blooming in his eyes.

‘That's it... just hold on a little longer, just a little longer...’

But the ink-robed youth’s expression was one of surprising disgust. His golden eyes were incomparably tyrannical, gazing down with contempt. Finally, his cold voice was heard.

“You dare play such tricks before this King.”

In that instant, the halberd flashing with Heavenly Light finally vanished. A single point of bright crimson flashed at the horizon, like an emperor's tear or the blood of the masses, raising the curtain on a chaotic age as it sheared the dark skyline in two.

‘It's that bloody light... that bloody light...’

Xiaodisa remembered it all.

Gongsun Bei had perished under this very art!

The scene of the sky filling with blood was identical, but the Li Zhouwei of today was even stronger.

He, who had once smiled while coldly observing Gongsun Bei's fate, was now finally experiencing the despair of being under this art. Yet he did not seize the moment the divine ability was released to flee. Instead, he struck with all his might, using all his power to transmit his voice,

“Do not fight him head-on!”

The massive jackal-bodied, wolf-headed figure froze in place.

Renshijia's figure also stopped, fossilized. Bright tears of blood streamed from his eyes.

It was too fast.

The Bright Yang suppression, combined with Li Zhouwei's unnaturally high Dao-Profundity, meant that whether it was spell arts or divine abilities, they were unleashed with almost no time to gather power. It left the two Six-Generation Mahas, cut off from their Buddhist Land, completely unable to mount any effective resistance.

_Boom!_

A violent shockwave attempted to rise and spread in all directions. Xiaodisa’s desperate strike with the black urn was blocked by a single hand. Sima Yuanli, struggling to even stay upright amid the shock to his body and mind, suddenly saw the White Qilin make a peculiar gesture.

He first took a step forward, then leaned back and sat upon the void.

_Dong!_

A deep, powerful, and extremely distant sound of a morning bell traveled from afar. The intense shockwaves were condensed into every inch of the river water, all vibrations freezing in that instant.

Imperial Observation of the Origin.

It was as if a great hand had passed over, forcibly smoothing out all auras and fluctuations. Cries of "Long Live" echoed from nowhere, ringing in his ears. Formless golden light flowed as a majestic, imposing, and massive profound throne materialized inch by inch, allowing King Wei to be seated with composure.

Palace lanterns flickered as the east began to pale. Sima Yuanli was clearly standing still, yet it felt as if a thousand gates were opening in response. Palace doors of black and gold opened one by one, revealing rows of heavenly generals in golden armor. An Imperial Monarch gazed down from above, surveying all within the cosmos!

“King Wei!”

Renshijia had already collapsed before the great hall.

He lay face-up, the cracks on his visage flickering in and out of view. Audience with the Celestial Gate pinned him firmly to the ground, rendering him immobile. Bright flames, accompanied by bone-chilling Heavenly Light, passed back and forth through the Maha's body.

“King Wei!”

This Dharma Protector Maha was clearly grievously wounded and unable to move, yet he struggled to lift his head and call out,

“King Wei! My disciple-brother and I were only seeking treasure, we had no intention of offending you... King Wei!”

His terrified voice echoed within the hall. Sima Yuanli stood to the side, his gaze vacant. Xiaodisa was even further away, staring at the great hall from a distance, his heart filled with infinite dread as a thousand thoughts raced through his mind.

‘Imperial Observation of the Origin... This is Imperial Observation of the Origin...’

‘Leave... How can I leave...’

Fear and madness intertwined in his eyes. The dignified Earth-Governing Maha actually seemed at a complete loss. The profound urn in his hand flickered, as if he was about to sacrifice this famous Enlightened Artifact, which he had refined for many years, to save his own life!

Amidst this oppressive, heavy presence, the Monarch above raised his head. His golden gaze seemed to pierce through the cosmos to focus on Xiaodisa. The White Qilin raised a hand to his lips, making a hushing gesture.

All sound ceased.

Xiaodisa understood his meaning.

‘If I act, I can certainly escape, but he will definitely kill Renshijia.’

‘He will kill him... Within this hall, his word is law.’

Renshijia’s pleas for mercy echoed through the hall, but Xiaodisa remained eerily still. The Enlightened Artifact in his hand continued to flicker, yet he made no further move.

“Sima Yuanli!”

The profound voice was sudden. Being within the hall subjected both body and mind to an unbearable, terrifying pressure. Sima Yuanli immediately stepped forward, his voice low.

“Your subordinate is here!”

The King Wei above said quietly:

“Go.”

That single word was an imperial command. The doors behind them swung open, revealing an endless tunnel leading back to the deep, dark waters. Sima Yuanli felt the terrifying scene rapidly receding.

“Get as far away as possible, as fast as you can.”

The voice gradually faded. As the last word sounded, he was already sinking back into the deep water.

“What happens next is not something you can interfere in.”

The voice lingered by his ear. Sima Yuanli steadied himself, looking around as if waking from a dream. Having left the great hall, the terrifying pressure was gone, but his heart suddenly filled with unease.

The river water... had changed!

While inside Li Zhouwei's divine ability, he hadn't noticed a thing. But now that he was free, he discovered the Great Tomb River was shaking violently, as if the entire world were spinning before his eyes!

“It's the river water…”

Every inch of the river had lost its current, surging madly upward, mixed with gravel and glittering fragments that streaked past his eyes. Panic surged in his heart. He frantically activated his divine ability, hearing Yang Xuancai’s terrified voice ring out.

“Below! Fellow Daoist Qinghu!”

Sima Yuanli looked down and saw that within the pitch-black river, some boundless behemoth was riding the current toward them at astonishing speed, its size terrifying to behold!

“Damnation! Is this Great Tomb River any place for a person to be!”

Sima Yuanli’s hair stood on end. He seemed to instantly understand why Changyun, a man who always reaped every advantage, had been unwilling to come. Without hesitation, he fled into the distance, plunging into the deep, dark water, ignorant of what dangers lurked within.

...

The sky was dark with rain.

The rain grew heavier, and the river water, once like polished iron, was now pockmarked by the falling drops, its surface turbulent. A faint, sharp cry echoed from the sky, chilling the soul.

The water level rose, first inch by inch, then foot by foot, surging violently. Its reflection in the black-robed man's eyes made him take a deep breath and exhale slowly.

‘The Judgement Prison is about to rise.’

He stood with his hands behind his back, phantom-like, his eyes fixed grimly on the water’s surface. The shadows behind him shifted constantly. After an unknown time, he finally saw someone emerge from the clouds.

This person was well-groomed and handsome. He strode over with a smile. The black-robed man saw him, offered a salute, and said quietly,

“Senior Heyun!”

Dongfang Heyun smiled at him and said, “Officer Yang, it is indeed rare that you and I should meet again in this place.”

This black-robed man was shockingly the same Officer Yang who had met Xiao Chuting in Jiangnan all those years ago!

The officer was indifferent, replying coolly, “It is rare indeed. There are few northern grotto-heavens to which the 'mountain' does not send someone. Since they sent no one, there is no one to restrain you, allowing you to run rampant.”

Dongfang Heyun said,

“Regarding Pit Water, the 'mountain' and the 'sea' are in agreement. Since that one from Pit Water has come, there is naturally no need for them to act. Why would they send anyone? It is just... with both our sides in agreement, the Underworld is the only one inconvenienced.”

“We are not inconvenienced.”

Officer Yang sneered.

“My Underworld has no interest in Pit Water.”

His focused gaze remained fixed on the surging river, as if awaiting something. He continued flatly,

“We want the Great Tomb River and Xiao Chuting's True Spirit. As long as you provide those two benefits and do not interfere in our affairs, you may do as you please.”

“Then consider it settled!”

Dongfang Heyun gave an ambiguous smile and also looked down, watching the churning water. Something as black as ink was slowly rising, drawing closer to the surface.

“Boom!”

Bright thunder cracked across the sky as a vast, pitch-black platform finally breached the water!

The platform was like profound iron, black as ink, and it occupied more than half the river's surface, stretching along the current as if boundless. Looking down from their position, they could finally see a slight curvature in its endless expanse.

As the platform rose, its black sides and iron pillars of varying lengths were revealed. Their material was unknown, but they emitted a faint, profound light. They held no aura of a divine ability, yet possessed a dangerous quality that stung the eyes. After an unknown time, its dark bottom finally emerged.

Endless cascades of water poured down from between the dark pillars. This structure rising from the riverbed was, shockingly, a massive, ring-shaped black prison!

The Great Tomb River itself was a ring, a endlessly swirling river. The so-called Judgement Prison was rising flush against the inner wall of the Great Tomb River—a massive, circular prison.

Dongfang Heyun's expression showed no surprise. He had already looked away, staring strangely into the distance.

There, at the edge of the sky, clouds roiled and rain fell like a cascade. An old man in a straw cloak, carrying a fishing rod on his shoulder, strode down. The Pit Water divine ability emanating from him was world-shaking, seeming to tear the very clouds apart.

“Xiao Chuting!"

This Daoist Master was already different from when he arrived. Who knows what benefits he had obtained in the grotto-heaven, but his aura was even more astonishing. A small, bright-bronze cauldron now hung from his waist, its color chilling the soul!

In that instant, the entire world seemed to sense his aura and tilt toward him. Myriad colors swarmed in his direction, as if bearing infinite might.

As Xiao Chuting, a Great Daoist Master who had perfected five ancient Pit Water divine abilities, he had clearly received an unprecedented augmentation in this Great Tomb Heaven, truly reaching the pinnacle of his power!

Yet even as such a Great Daoist Master stood proudly in the sky, someone still dared to quietly bar his path!

This man was dressed in black, his face fair. Gazing from afar, he saw Xiao Chuting, and a trace of pity flashed across his features. He pressed his palms together and spoke,

“Fellow Daoist Xiao.”

Xiao Chuting was in no hurry to strike, merely watching him quietly. The monk said softly,

“Within the Judgement Prison, there is something I must retrieve. I am afraid I must trouble you, Fellow Daoist, to permit me to enter and take it later.”

The old man gave a wizened smile.

“I would like to hear the details.”

Kongshu paused, announced his Buddhist name once more, and said softly,

“Years ago, an ancestor of my path, the great River-Watcher of the Feather-Shedding Land, sought the true fruition. He bound his own hands in surrender, allowing himself to be captured and left in the Great Tomb River to contemplate treasures within the prison. Later, he perished for reasons unknown, and the Dharma Pool Treasured Land has been lost ever since.”

“A great one of my path has calculated that the River-Watcher should have left a Sarira behind in the prison.”

Xiao Chuting replied quietly, “Immortals and Buddhists walk different paths. You are asking the wrong person, Fellow Daoist.”

The instant his voice fell, several golden bodies flared into existence in the distance, spanning the sky in an encircling formation, as if to trap Kongshu!

And on Xiao Chuting's face, opposite him, flickered the light of distant fire and surging Valley Water, as a cosmos-shaking laugh echoed from the sky.

“Xiao Chuting, long time no see!”

Though the voice was laughing, it held the distinct sound of gritted teeth. Raging True Fire tore through the sky, incinerating the endless gloomy clouds and claiming a patch of the heavens for itself!

It was Tianque!

As a Great Daoist Master cultivating the True Fire Dao, he was suppressed by this world, yet his momentum was still blazing and inexhaustible. Clearly, his Dao-Profundity was extremely high. Behind him stood several Golden Oneness Daoist Masters, their expressions varied, but mostly complex.

‘Xiao Chuting...’

The Golden Oneness faction had not misjudged many people, but Xiao Chuting was one of them. Whether it was Tianque, Tianhuo, or even the long-deceased Tianyuan—aside from Qiushui, who was in seclusion and still recalled some old sentiment for the Xiao family—all the others had plotted against him.

Yet he had survived all the way to this day.

Facing this group of Golden Oneness Daoist Masters, Xiao Chuting slowly revealed a smile. His expression was grim as he said,

“Golden Oneness is different from the other families; this, I know. That I am here today, I must thank your 'Lords' for showing mercy.”

This sentence made Tianhuo’s gaze flicker slightly.

Tianque’s expression did not change. He turned to the side and said,

“This battle is not for you. All of you, disperse.”

A trace of regret flashed in the eyes of a carefree-looking Daoist Master to the side, saddened that he would miss this 'verifying the Dao' scene, a sight rarely seen in a century. He had no objections, however, and smiled,

“This junior shall go find Suyun. It is far too dangerous here; we mustn't let her be injured.”
