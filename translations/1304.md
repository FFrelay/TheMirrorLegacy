# Chapter 1304: Contesting the Dao

‘Xiyang Abbey.’

These three words echoed between heaven and earth, causing the expression beneath the old man's brow to flicker for an instant. He carefully studied the face of the Daoist Master before him and said softly,

"So you are an eminent cultivator from the mountain!"

His eyes held no nervousness or panic; instead, they gained a measure of peace.

At least it was not Xueyang who had come.

"I cannot be considered an eminent cultivator, much less claim to be from the mountain... I am merely a destitute soul."

A faint smile touched Qu Wo's gaunt face. His gaze swept over the boundless blue sea in the sky as he said softly:

"The [Dwelling in the Pit-Stream]... what a fine opportunity for Dao-accomplishment!"

He raised both hands, his wide robes rustling in the wind, making him seem like a mere mortal.

"I, Qu Wo, am already old. The Quest for Gold is hopeless for me. I have come for a mission..."

He glanced at the boundless blue radiance, and at Xiao Chuting, whose divine ability grew denser within it, seemingly unconcerned that time was granting his opponent an advantage.

"Although the Great Tomb River belongs to Encompassing Profundity, it is also of the Five Virtues Orthodox Nature. The Lesser Yang Dao-path's position is at the head of Comprehending Profundity, and it regards immortal virtue. I dare not be negligent."

His expression was solemn.

"My abbey does not wish for the Great Tomb River's opportunity to be easily lost, but neither can we act high-and-mighty, judging who is fit to walk the Encompassing Profundity Dao. I have come this time not to call down thunder and lightning, nor to forcefully interrupt your seeking the Dao."

He smiled.

"You and I shall not rely on external objects, but will contend using only Dao debate and spell arts. If you are bested by me, nothing more need be said; but if you can overcome this Dao-obstacle I present, you will have earned the qualification for seeking the Dao."

The old man before him lifted his fishing rod, apparently unfazed by his words, his voice light and distant,

"It is not someone from the Wu Light after all."

These words seemed to strike a chord with Qu Wo. Despite the vast brilliance already rising around him, he moved his lips and spoke again.

"The Wu Light commands destiny; it is not for you or I to know."

As the last word fell, the brilliance erupted. Light flashed to its absolute extreme, then transformed into a dense darkness that spread from east to west, enveloping and swallowing all illusory colors.

His aura was at first exceptionally faint, showing no trace of a divine ability's light, yet in that instant, as the darkness spread, it transformed into an endless pressure that weighed upon everyone's heart.

What flickered about his body was not the five paths of divine abilities, but a radiance of extreme condensation.

This radiance manifested as the calamity of a dark, looming sky, or as terrifying, unending wicked karma. It roiled with water and fire, splitting the clear from the turbid, and nearly every cultivator felt a sense of mortal danger from him, as if facing a natural predator!

In the distance, Chiguang also paused his battle, his expression dark and cold as he watched the faraway darkness, a hint of shock visible.

Yet this radiance flickered for only a moment before colliding with the roiling Pit Water within the darkness, instantly transforming into flames of various hues—some bright, some dark, some scattering, some merging—all pouring down to envelop Xiao Chuting.

As the raging flames filled his vision, the old Daoist Master finally showed a flicker of surprise.

‘Profound Qi.’

This Qu Wo was, shockingly, a Profound Qi cultivator!

Moreover, the roiling Profound Qi about his body lacked the slightest tinge of Profound Yellow Qi, nor did it have any turbid darkness; there was only a magnificent, radiant calamity.

This was actually a Daoist priest who ingested qi, nurtured his nature, and cultivated disaster and karma!

The old man, standing within the flames, stared at the flickering light on his opponent's body, a flash of realization in his eyes.

‘Transforming Pit Water and expelling fire... the heavenly duty of the Profound Dark.’

Subduing the weak by descending and merging was an acquired art attributed to Emperor Wu of Liang, but transforming Pit Water and expelling fire had existed since ancient times!

Within the darkness, the searing, multicolored flames descended upon him. The straw cape and hat, which until now had seemed utterly undamaged, finally trembled and emitted a defiant glow.

Xiao Chuting raised his hands and brought them together before him. An endless cascade of water plummeted down as the Pit Water of the entire world answered his call once more, gathering to resist the flames descending from the sky.

But Qu Wo, as a Daoist priest of Xiyang Abbey, possessed an extremely orthodox divine ability that was by no means easily resisted. Even with the power of the Great Tomb River, Xiao Chuting was still rapidly suppressed by the calamitous fires, forced to watch helplessly as the flames closed in!

......

_Splash!_

The Pit Water in the sky formed a massive, sky-piercing pillar of light, extinguishing all other colors as it condensed beneath that ethereal radiance. This caused heaven and earth to tremble, and the water level in the grotto-heaven rose ever more rapidly, emitting a faint, sharp cracking sound.

The light in the sky grew brighter. As the boundless blue radiance of the [Dwelling in the Pit-Stream] scattered, and heaven and earth trembled, a dense web of cracks crept up the Profound Prison.

Streams of spiritual water began to gush from the fissures. Spiritual resources and spiritual items of varying grades appeared and disappeared along the long boundary. The powerful experts who had been circling and watching finally saw their chance, crossing the dark prison and diving deep within to fight and plunder.

But the gazes of the Great Daoist Masters did not shift to these corners; they remained fixed on the boundless blue sea. Qu Wo's divine ability soared ever higher, pinning Xiao Chuting and gradually lifting him from the water's surface. Streams of light shot out from the sky, led by a flickering Treasure Light that illuminated the horizon.

The object was an arm's length, entirely blue-green. It was a long-necked jade pot with bright, glazed patterns. Having lost the protection of its owner's divine abilities, its aura suddenly blazed forth, making the assembled experts shudder. The woman with the osmanthus mark between her brows snapped her head up, her gaze sharp.

‘The Heavenly Jade Water Vase!’

‘A Spiritual Treasure!’

None of the experts who could remain here were simple. Sensing the profound aura emanating from the sky, everyone understood one thing clearly.

"This item is no ordinary thing!"

Since the Judgement Prison contained Metallic Essence, these items must have all been nourished to some extent. Even if they were not close to the Metallic Essence within the prison, being steeped in that boundless blue sea for so many years must have granted them unique benefits!

Whether it was Xiao Chuting, who held the legacy, or the god-like Qu Wo, any discerning person could see that their battle had become a clash between titans. Since the [Dwelling in the Pit-Stream] was now their battlefield, the Metallic Essence was naturally beyond the reach of the other cultivators.

‘This is the next best thing—these items accumulated by the Chen Clan over many years are now even more potent than before; not even a Great Daoist Master would dare underestimate them!’

Flickering in the sky was not just the jade pot, but also long sabers and jade pearls... They shone brilliantly, tumbling within the [Dwelling in the Pit-Stream] as if ready to fly out at any second. Several ongoing battles abruptly ceased; even Chiguang turned his head and soared into the air!

True Fire blazed as Tianque stood in the air. A long, narrow rift appeared behind him, spewing golden flames. The blue-robed youth stood in mid-air, remaining silent all the while.

But Han Ling, who should have been shielding him, had sunk to the river's surface. She wiped a trace of blood from her red lips, her moon-bright gaze fixed on a nimbly shifting bronze longsword.

The sword's owner wore a Daoist robe; his hair was full and black, but his face was ancient. He stared at her quietly.

‘Zhu Kui...’

The woman immediately understood.

‘He has come to curry favor with the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition.’

This Daoist Master had wandered the northern regions for many years and knew her Han Family's disposition well; they would never involve with the major powers unless absolutely forced. Han Ling must have come to this grotto-heaven alone. Even if he blocked her, she would not seek trouble with him later.

‘But this matter is extremely important to the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition... it is likely worth a favor.’

She had only just passed the Purple Mystery, and her Dao lineage was weak. Facing Tianque was already a strain, and she had suffered minor injuries; subduing this old Daoist would be even more difficult. She could only say softly:

"With all these treasures manifesting, you are not going to contend for them, fellow Daoist?"

"Fairy Han, you are too polite!"

The old Daoist's voice was hoarse and carried a sinister air.

"This one is in no hurry."

Though he was a rogue cultivator, he showed not the slightest hint of greed. Even if his heart was stirred, his tone remained calm.

"Daoist Master Chiguang's divine ability is tyrannical and his methods profound; naturally, he gets first pick. With everyone else watching, unless one has the power to suppress the entire crowd, striking first in a battle like this does not guarantee victory."

"Furthermore..."

He gave a cold laugh, his gaze pausing on the distance for a moment.

"I will not speak of the Sarira, but the White Curtain Old Dream Tower and the Long Shrine Profound-Mystery Diagram... these truly good items have not yet appeared. I see you are waiting as well, fellow Daoist!"

Zhu Kui was a mere rogue cultivator, his talent lacking compared to the geniuses of the great Daoist Traditions. To have muddled his way to the rank of Great Daoist Master, he naturally possessed a unique insight and skill, which made her sigh inwardly.

"What a pity!"

Her gaze shifted to Tianque. The two met eyes for a moment, neither showing any surprise.

For Daoist Traditions of their caliber, both understood the changes within the Great Tomb River. Although the Metallic Essence was a slight surprise, upon careful consideration, it was not entirely unexpected.

The True Fire Great Daoist Master in the sky merely stood quietly, watching the distant battle and admiring the sky-filling brilliance of the Pit Water. The roiling True Fire tightly encircled Su Yan behind him.

Su Yan lowered his head, a hint of shock finally surfacing in his eyes. As the brilliance slowly spread, illusions flickered in his vision—winding streams and cascading rivers. He felt the divine ability and dharma power surging within him, overcome with an urge to sit cross-legged and cultivate.

The man before him merely turned his head slightly and said softly,

"Do you feel it? This [Dwelling in the Pit-Stream] was originally prepared for Chen Xuanli. The Chen Clan spent generations of accumulation, silently nourishing it with this Metallic Essence, and even had that Mansion Water True Monarch take action personally, all to secretly arrange for the Pit Water to return to its orthodox path."

His tone held both regret and pity.

"They were utterly stubborn, earning the hatred of both sea and sky and leading to their current fate. Yet, this opportunity has been passed down. This is what Xiao Chuting schemes for. If you were also at the peak of your divine ability, your speed of absorption today would not be less than a third of his."

A trace of complexity crossed his features.

"With every passing breath, the [Dwelling in the Pit-Stream] bestows profound mysteries, nourishing your life-mandate. This is an extremely precious resource, one that tugs at the strings of fate. Every portion you take, you diminish his momentum by that same portion. This will be of great benefit to your future in seeking the Dao and attaining Gold."

Tianque paused, then turned his head, his smile unreadable.

"Of course... you must at least get out of here alive."

Su Yan raised his head, staring at the boundless blue dharma power roiling in his palm as he heard the Great Daoist Master laugh.

"Xiao Chuting is also benefiting. Daoist Master Qu is formidable, true, but Xiao Chuting grows stronger with every passing breath. With a Metallic Essence supporting him, he will sooner or later possess the strength to suppress all."

"However..."

"If this drags on too long, whether he remains Xiao Chuting, or becomes 'He Who Embodies the Perilous Pit Water,' is another question entirely."

His voice was faint, yet it struck like thunder. The man's blue robes fluttered as his eyes erupted with a piercing light, staring fixedly at Tianque.

"I hear Dongfang Heyun has arrived. If the Dragon-kin are determined for Senior Xiao to succeed, they can just slap me to death. I have long seen your attitude clearly; I simply have no other path."

"Hahahahaha!"

Tianque's eyes crinkled with amusement.

"Su Yan, what the dragon soaring in the heavens is thinking, only those who sit in the heavens can know. But in this world, few are willing to give you even a sliver of opportunity. Follow us. You are not without a path—quite the opposite."

The True Fire in his eyes blazed, revealing a cold calm.

"This is a game between great figures, but it is also your opportunity. Those standing by Daoist Master Xiao do not necessarily wish him well, and those opposing him do not necessarily hate him. But in the end, a battle must be fought. You are right. Perhaps you will be slapped to death by Dongfang Heyun, or perhaps you will be swallowed by that rolling yin qi. I do not care how you die; I only care that you live."

Su Yan was with Golden Feather, and Tianhuo and the others were all polite to him. Only Tianque—perhaps because he disliked these methods, or perhaps because he simply looked down on him—treated him with nothing but a polite coldness. Now, however, there was a trace of solemnity in his voice as he said quietly.

"If you make it out of this alive, I will take you to the Azure Revolution Heaven."

Distant thunder cracked across the sky. Within the roiling clouds, there seemed to be a dragon's cry and an incessant, boiling gold. Tianque raised his hand and placed a longsword, tranquil all over, into his.

"How to use it, how to hide... Tianhuo and the others have already taught you."

But Su Yan's gaze did not linger on the sword. His hand slowly closed around the hilt, his knuckles turning white, while his eyes reflected the dense gold at the horizon.

It was a Daoist Master in fluttering white robes.

His face was calm and his cheeks gaunt, his deep-set eye sockets flickered with two sword-like pupils, and between his brows was a single point of blackness, holding neither edge nor sharpness.

Su Yan knew him.

The Reflecting Metal Sword Immortal, Lingmei.

The instant this white-robed figure was reflected in his vision, a circular, bright-gold halo lit up the sky, like a massive formation enveloping the heavens or a wall of light, and flickering in the sky, a streak of white light came whistling over.

Pear blossoms rustled, blanketing the ground in white.

It was unknown when he had arrived, or why he had struck. This Sword Intent shot across the sky, aimed directly at the True Fire enveloping the area. Su Yan, though shielded behind layers of True Fire, could still feel the bone-piercing chill.

In that same instant, Tianque finally stopped treating him with his usual cold expression, gone was the attitude of a monitor and guard, replaced by a conversation between equals. The Great Daoist Master's face flickered in the light, but he no longer called him Su Yan.

"Daoist Friend Su."

This address still lingered in his ears as a golden token flew high. A thick cascade of flames, shifting from golden-yellow to bright white, hung horizontally in the air. The figure in the sky stood like a god of fire, his massive back casting a long shadow of True Fire that completely enveloped Su Yan's form, leaving only five cold, echoing words.

"We are on our own."
