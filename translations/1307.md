# Chapter 1307: My Vision, My Design (Part 1)

The rain gradually subsided. Far-off dark clouds overlapped, and the radiance of divine abilities flashed like thunder, illuminating the cloud layers in bursts of light and shadow.

All the storms raged in the center of the Grotto-Heaven, yet this specific place seemed tranquil. Only the surface of the water roiled as if in anger, churning beneath the divine abilities, faintly reflecting the silhouettes of several people.

The Boundless Ocean's phenomena undulated on the horizon, causing the golden-robed young master to smile and shake his head. He turned, filled with emotion, to look at the brother and sister standing upon the water.

"King Wei is formidable after all! He lost!"

The statement was casual, treating Su Yan's death as if it were a trivial chip; once lost, it was not worth mentioning. What he admired more was the unexpected variable.

"King Wei grasped the Purple Mystery with such ease. Even a reincarnated True Monarch would be no different!"

"Senior, you overpraise me."

Li Quewan stood quietly, her mood surprisingly calmer. Her gaze remained fixed on the horizon as she listened to Tianhuo laugh.

"It is not an exaggeration... not at all."

His smile held deep contemplation, but he saw the crimson-robed man watching him intently and suddenly speak.

"This junior has a matter he does not understand. I wonder if Senior would be willing to explain."

Tianhuo's train of thought was broken. He shifted his gaze to him and said,

"Please speak, Young Master."

Li Jiangqian raised his head slightly and spoke softly.

"It is often said that Metal Virtue lies in the Noble Dao, and all matters of Metal Virtue are interrelated... yet they do not involve Water Virtue. The Noble Dao also emphasizes acting according to the prevailing momentum. Now, within this Grotto-Heaven, working alongside various rogue cultivators does not seem like the way of the Noble Dao."

"I do not understand... why must the Golden Oneness involve itself in the affairs of Pit Water?"

Tianhuo gazed at him, seemingly judging the purpose behind his words, and quickly replied.

"It may look to you as though my Golden Oneness is interfering with Pit Water, but that is not the case. 'Interference' would only apply if Xiao Chuting actually had a chance at Dao-accomplishment. Since he is destined to fail whether we intervene or not, this cannot be called interference."

"This is merely preventing him from wasting more of the Dwelling in the Pit-Stream."

His gaze was intense as he looked at the two of them.

"On this matter, my Golden Oneness has never lied. From start to finish, the Azure Revolution Heaven has made no official statement. My father, however, privately revealed a single sentiment: such a fine Great Tomb River... it would be a shame to waste it."

Li Jiangqian watched him, his words showing no hesitation, as if his speech had been prepared long in advance. His tone was crisp and decisive.

"It is said... the Dragon-kin do not think this way. They harbor the intent to eliminate a True Monarch of Pit Water. At the very least, his success would give them the opportunity to do so."

_Boom!_

Distant thunder cracked once more, and a brilliant light instantly filled the world, illuminating Tianhuo's face. The expression on his face froze for an instant before quickly melting into a smile.

"First Young Master... If not for this, how could Xiao Chuting have been driven to this desperate struggle, to possess the will for Dao-accomplishment? If it were not said this way, how would you, Moongaze Lake, have been convinced to help him!"

"As for why he cannot succeed..."

His golden robes glittered in the radiance filling the world. Tianhuo spoke with great solemnity.

"First Young Master, I do not know. I only know... this is 'Pit Water'."

"This is a provocation to the Arbiter of Fate, the Wu Earth. If... if there were even the slightest possibility... he would succeed."

In the distance, Pit Water was gradually gaining the upper hand. A deep blue radiance converged, seeming to brew an infinitely bright future. The Grotto-Heaven emitted an overburdened hum. Li Jiangqian silently gazed at this direct descendant of the Golden Oneness.

"There is a certain Dharma Treasure... I wonder if you two know of it?"

Tianhuo's voice grew softer.

"The Divine Thunder Profound-Sound Drum."

...

Pit Water surged, flooding the heavens.

Gray clouds spread between heaven and earth, and an extremely low sound seemed to emanate from beyond. Within the endless Pit Water, all flames were extinguished simultaneously, transforming into a faint, dark-gray qi that sank toward the ground.

The old man stood alone in the sky.

Xiao Chuting's reed cloak had already been completely annihilated in the endless flames. Beneath his white robes, the fierce wind revealed his stooped figure. The Spiritual Artifacts he had painstakingly refined over the years, the talismans, and even the emerald fishing rod he had been nurturing since his Foundation Establishment Realm—all had been incinerated in that terrifying calamity fire.

Only that blue-rimmed bamboo hat remained.

He stood empty-handed. In that instant, he resembled an old wandering hero. His aged gaze rested on a tattered scrap of gray cloth, watching it drift down and sink into the water.

Qu Wo had fallen.

This ancient cultivator from Dry Yang Abbey was extremely capable. If not for being within the Great Tomb River, and if not for the various boons, Xiao Chuting would not have been his match.

Yet such a figure had left behind only an ocean of calamitous qi floating on the water's surface. Just like that, he had fallen at his hands.

Xiao Chuting knew why he had done it.

'Ancient Profound Qi is calamity itself, tribulation, and adversity. It is the unworthiness of attainment, the seeking without completion. One who overcomes the profound possesses the stature of receiving heaven's mandate, cultivating qi to ascend as a pure immortal.'

Qu Wo was right. He sought to make the attempt; success would have been his, Qu Wo's, opportunity for Dao-accomplishment, while failure would contribute to Xiao Chuting's Dao-accomplishment.

'Unfortunately, I do not cultivate the Twelve Qi. The benefit to me is not great. His good intentions were wasted.'

Regret and sorrow flashed through Xiao Chuting's eyes. He gazed deeply as the scrap of gray cloth sank beneath the surface, and ultimately, he gave a deep bow to this high cultivator of Dry Yang Abbey.

This bow caused the unfathomable calamitous qi to part to either side, revealing the surging water beneath. It was the result of him having overcome the Profound Qi, and it was also like a blessing and hope from Daoist Qu.

Xiao Chuting raised his head and looked toward the horizon.

The dark clouds in the sky were rapidly dispersing, revealing a gray-white yet tranquil skies behind them. Faint cracks began to appear, like streams meandering across the sky.

His aged eyes stared fixedly at the sky, as if he could see the infinite vistas beyond it. He waited quietly until all the calamitous qi on the ground had sunk beneath the water.

The old man unbound the blue-rimmed bamboo hat from his head, holding it in his hand, suspended at his side.

This mortal object, which had survived the great battle without any damage, finally dispersed like smoke as he loosened his grip.

The color of Pit Water surged into the heavens, driving the surrounding clouds and mist to the periphery.

One by one, divine abilities stood arrayed, their multicolored lights converging and spiritual energy lingering. Some were as bright as the sun, others as dark as the abyss. Some manifested as state scholars, old and young standing together; others as profound cultivators, the clear and turbid joining forces. All remained utterly silent.

The world watched with bated breath.

As the last mote of deep blue light descended, Xiao Chuting sat cross-legged. His hands formed a seal before him, and the radiance of the divine abilities at his back expanded like concentric, colorful halos.

And within that bright Heavenly Light, beneath the towering and magnificent Heavenly Gate, a black-robed youth stood with his hands clasped behind him, silently gazing at the scene. Yet, the sight before him brought him no joy.

There was only doubt.

The sounds in the world were not limited to thunder and waves. A whistling wind blew from the east, carrying with it a light, floating, and amused voice.

"King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. He saw a figure suddenly appear amidst the wind and rain, striding down to stand beside him within the Heavenly Gate.

The man was impeccably dressed, his hair and beard neatly groomed, and he appeared refined and courteous. His eyes seemed very clear, yet they held the faint, unsettling illusion of vertical, serpentine pupils, like those of a Flood Dragon.

Dongfang Heyun.

At this most critical juncture, this man—the strongest power the Dragon Monarch had infiltrated into the Grotto-Heaven, a figure capable of deciding the battle's outcome—should have been guarding the horizon. Yet he now ignored the great battle raging in the distance, strolling casually as if in a courtyard, to stand beside Li Zhouwei!

'It's this bane.'

Facing this unreasonable presence, whose might was enough to suppress all cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm's great divine ability, someone even a Great Daoist Master would have to be wary of, Li Zhouwei seemed quite familiar, speaking softly.

"Senior Dongfang."

But the spirit cultivator simply waved his hand and smiled.

"This one greets Your Highness. Qinghong is watching over there, so we do not fear that anyone with ill intentions will cause harm. Thus, I made a special trip!"

It was unclear whom he was referring to. Those rather terrifying eyes swept over the calm, ripple-less surface of the water, but he made no move. Yet, his words landed in Li Zhouwei's ears, causing a subtle change in his expression.

The strange feeling in his heart was known to none, but the radiance of the divine abilities was growing ever denser. Sensing the powerful aura rising in the distance, Dongfang Heyun whispered,

"He is about to verify the Dao..."

The doubt in Li Zhouwei's eyes was already concealed. He turned his head and asked softly,

"Is this as the Dragon Monarch wishes?"

Dongfang Heyun paused for a breath, then smiled.

"King Wei, why do you say such a thing?"

Li Zhouwei said quietly, "Once Daoist Master Xiao achieves Dao-accomplishment, the Cultivation Transcendence Sect will strike, driving him beyond the heavens. The Dragon-kin need only fan the flames to gain their chance at killing a Monarch of Pit Water..."

Dongfang Heyun raised a hand, his gaze on him momentarily complex.

"I am reminded of a saying. I wonder if King Wei has heard it..."

His smile faded.

"Back then, when Lord Du achieved Dao-accomplishment, he severed the path of Pristine Water. In the northern mountains, however, there was a Great Daoist Master on the verge of the Quest for Gold. Suddenly facing this calamity, he had no choice but to send someone to beg him. What a show of face, even someone surnamed Xue went, claiming that by joining forces, they could both win and allow him to advance further."

"But after much pleading, they received only a single sentence from Him."

"He said, 'My vision is sharp and clear, I oversee it as one wipes a divine shrine clean. My design is full and complete, I paint it without entrusting it to a mayfly's life.'"

He continued icily,

"We certainly do not like Him, but his words were not wrong. The stature of my Dragon-kin, the grand strategy of the True Dragons, is not based on the premise of entrusting our hopes to whether a mere cultivator like Xiao Chuting can achieve Dao-accomplishment. The same goes for the Netherworld, and the same goes for Mount Luoxia."

He gave Li Zhouwei a profound look and said,

"If he truly had a chance of succeeding, what if, after he succeeded, that one from the Cultivation Transcendence Sect simply chose not to act?"

A strange smile played in his eyes.

"Both are acts of overturning the profound world's Daoist Tradition. Is such a thing beyond Him?"

"As long as the True Monarchs remain silent, won't the 'mountain' grow anxious? For a thousand years, more than one faction has wished to see Them act. What a perfect opportunity... it could not be better."

"But how could the 'mountain' allow itself to be plotted against for nothing?"

"Moreover."

He said coldly,

"Your Highness should also know, the ones who should be most anxious are my Hornless Dragon descendants. The conflict between the 'mountain' and Pit Water is one of ideals; as a last resort, they can temporarily compromise. Our dispute with Pit Water is an irreconcilable struggle for Dao-accomplishment—it is either our death or theirs. If... if Xiao Chuting succeeds, the 'mountain' might ignore him for the sake of the Bright Yang's grand plan. But what about us, the Hornless Dragon descendants? Should we just stand in the sea and wait to die? Or should we slaughter our way onto the mainland?"

"We will not, and cannot, take that risk."

Dongfang Heyun's gaze suddenly turned icy and resolute. His voice became faint as he said quietly,

"Heyun's presence in this Grotto-Heaven this time is for one purpose, and one purpose only."

"Xiao Chuting must make his attempt. He must destroy this mortal world's only path to the orthodox Pit Water. But he will not truly succeed in verifying his Dao."

He raised his head to look at the sky.

"This is why the 'mountain' did not come, sending only someone from Dry Yang Abbey to make a desperate gamble. They did not come, yet it is better than if They had. And so, Qinghong and I were able to enter smoothly, to prevent Xiao Chuting from being harmed by some other party."

His words were casual, but his eyes swept over Li Zhouwei with a flash of mockery.

"Unfortunately, by a strange twist of fate, we let Tuoba Qiye slip away, catching only a small fry."

There was little surprise on Li Zhouwei's face. The moment he learned of Dongfang Heyun's appearance, he had a faint premonition. He raised his eyes and said softly,

"So, Senior Dongfang... you originally should have stopped me from killing Su Yan."

"That would have been too detrimental to our harmony."

Dongfang Heyun smiled inscrutably and suddenly turned his head.

"Young Master, in your opinion... where lies the crux of Daoist Master Xiao's breakthrough?"

He lowered his head, adjusting his sleeves.

"Su Yan? The Dwelling in the Pit-Stream? Or Qu Wo?"

King Wei, beside him, turned his head and said without hesitation,

"_The Vast Ocean_."

"Correct!"

Dongfang Heyun never once spared a glance for the old man sitting cross-legged in the sky. He was completely focused on his conversation with King Wei, nodding in approval.

"Your Highness truly possesses peerless talent. It all lies in the so-called 'Borrowing' of the Boundless Ocean. Xiao Chuting has been waiting for it, as have you. But the principle remains: in this game, we cannot possibly stake our hopes on an ephemeral mayfly. That would be child's play."

He glanced at the old man sitting between heaven and earth. The Pit Water throughout the Grotto-Heaven began to boil, and the five divine abilities behind him seemed poised to materialize. Yet the gray-white sky remained as smooth as a mirror, without the slightest ripple.

The emotion in Li Zhouwei's eyes had changed. His golden pupils glanced at the not-quite-Demon, not-quite-human existence beside him, his voice slightly hoarse.

"That Mansion Water True Monarch from Cangzhou... was he intercepted, or was there never any 'borrowing' to begin with? Is He merely using this as an opportunity to find an escape route?"

These words echoed in the narrow space of the divine ability, causing the courteous man's sleeve-adjusting motion to freeze. His posture remained, but his face slowly turned, his voice laced with a strange amusement.

"Your Highness."

"There is no Mansion Water True Monarch in Cangzhou."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes met his, all emotion congealing within his pupils.

"Xuan Cang... does not exist?"

"Your Highness has guessed incorrectly."

Dongfang Heyun began to laugh. Due to the sudden rush of emotion, the corners of his mouth stretched uncontrollably toward his ears, revealing rows of gleaming white teeth.

"Lord Xuan Cang's position is within Pit Water."

"He holds the Intercalary Position of the Pit's excess, with the duty of the Vast Mansion Water. What Xiao Chuting saw was naturally a wisp of His divine mystery. As for the 'sky-leak' and the flooding of Pit Water in Cangzhou, those were not malicious schemes, but my Hornless Dragon descendants awakening His cause and effect."

He exhaled a long breath, raising his head to gaze smilingly at the sky. The pale, weak heavens reflected in his eyes a vast figure that spanned the cosmos.

"Correct. King Wei guessed one thing right: there was never any 'Borrowing' of the 'Boundless Ocean'."

"Because He _is_ that Intercalary Position of Pit Water, the one Xiao Chuting guarded against so desperately and only managed to divine after reaching Jiangnan, and the True Monarch who helped the 'excess' achieve the Dao at the end of the Liang dynasty—it has been Him, from the very beginning."
