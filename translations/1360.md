# Chapter 1360: The Yanhua Dao

Changyun followed behind, his heart full of doubts, but Li Ximing had long since paid him no mind, raising his head to look forward, where he immediately saw several steps before the courtyard glowing faintly green in the darkness.

Lu An turned back and said, “Since neither of us are of the Yu clan, nor do we belong to the Yanhua Profound Dao, please come this way to the side.”

Clearly, the main entrance was reserved for their true successors, so Li Ximing followed him through a small side door, already forming a plan in his mind.

‘I must ask around and listen carefully, the better to adapt to the situation as it unfolds…’

Night had already fallen, and inside the side door, a cultivator was meditating under the night sky. He was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, with a face somewhat similar to Yu Xixin's, and he now rose to greet them, apparently having already recognized them, and said with deference,

“Yu Heng of the Yu clan greets the esteemed Daoist Masters!”

In a place that Purple Mansion cultivators from the outside world longed to visit for comprehension, a mere Foundation Establishment disciple stood perpetual guard by the door. Li Ximing nodded and stepped inside, only then seeing the pitch-dark corridor within, along with the pale green silk draperies hanging on both sides.

Lu An then said with a smile, “Fellow Daoist Zhaojing! Be ready!”

Li Ximing was momentarily taken aback.

In an instant, a flow of qi vastly different from the outside world rushed to meet him, causing him to pause. The Life Divine Ability within his body throbbed without cease, as if to remind him this place was different, while the spiritual vitality became exceedingly stable, gradually tending toward a balance of yin and yang.

He paused, nonplussed, and muttered to himself, ‘It’s not really that astonishing…’

But Lu An at his side was already gazing at him with a smile, saying lightly, “A few years ago… there was a spiritual phenomenon in the south, called the 【Profoundly Balanced Atmosphere】. It had a hint of the flavor of yin-yang balance, but in truth, the spiritual vitality of the mortal world is too shallow to be worth mentioning. Only now that you have arrived here, fellow Daoist, cwill you truly understand the meaning of Great Divine Power!”

Hearing this, Li Ximing finally understood the implication, and he did not know whether to laugh or cry.

‘He means to say… that this level of yin-yang balance… is considered incredible…!’

But to be blunt, compared to the richness of spiritual vitality and the absolute balance of yin and yang within his own 【Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance】, this place was far too lacking!

Still, he had to give the man some face. He raised his head and exclaimed in admiration, “How rare!”

Lu An smiled and stroked his beard, saying, “The denser the spiritual vitality, the more difficult it is to achieve a balance of yin and yang. Besides a few great grotto-heavens, there are likely only a handful of places in the mortal world capable of this degree of yin-yang transformation!”

As Li Ximing carefully perceived it, he came to a realization.

‘There are some differences… The yin and yang here seem to be driven by some wondrous mechanism. This mechanism converts excess yin into yang and surplus yang into yin, thereby maintaining a balance that ebbs and flows…’

If he, Li Ximing, were to use a Bright Yang divine ability here, yang would overwhelm yin for close to an hour before the balance was restored…

In contrast, the yin-yang balance in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance was as if forged from iron, completely transcending all divine abilities and transformations. No matter how one might disturb or alter it, the equilibrium remained as solid as rock and steel!

‘In other words, the yin and yang here are merely regulated by some wondrous mechanism, something still within the conceptual bounds of divine abilities… unlike that other place, which is simply dumbfounding.’

Lu An began to extol its virtues, speaking of the many benefits this place offered for various transformations. Li Ximing had already heard all of this from his Suyun, so he merely gave a polite acknowledgment and then said with a smile, “I have heard of Donghua and Gonghua, but as for Yanhua… that name is unfamiliar to me.”

Lu An paused and glanced at Yu Heng. The Daoist immediately stepped forward and said respectfully, “To answer the Daoist Master, Yanhua is ranked beneath Azure Profundity. The Ancestral Master’s title is Zhidu, and he is known as the 『True Monarch of Luminous Passage, Active Derivation, and Transcendent Cultivation』 and the 『Profound Monarch of the Serene Two Principles』. He was a Grand Culmination of Profound Virtue who established a Great Dao before departing for the realms beyond the heavens…”

Li Ximing froze.

Zhidu?!

He knew that name, of course!

The Sun Seeker Ring!

‘Imperial Monarch Bright Yang will be slain by him!’

He knew this figure possessed exceedingly high divine abilities and was intimately connected to his own clan’s destiny, but he had never imagined that this was the so-called Yanhua!

In that instant, a chill rushed to his heart as these words suddenly surfaced in his mind; the message Li Quewan had brought back from Golden Unity years ago still echoed in his ears.

Li Ximing said grimly, “I have heard of the Evolving Splendor[^1] of Highest Azure. That would be this same Yanhua, I presume!”

After he spoke, he observed them secretly, and indeed, the people behind him paused for a moment.

Lu An did not answer, but Yu Heng, who was after all a junior cultivator with shallow experience, nodded and said, “Yes! He was on the same Dao-path as the True Monarch of my Yu clan from that time!”

Li Ximing’s heart leaped.

‘They truly were disciple-brothers…’

The benevolent stance of the Golden Unity in this grand game finally had a foundation, and Li Ximing gritted his teeth inwardly.

‘Imperial Monarch Bright Yang will be slain by him! That was a command from the Ancestral Master of True Monarch Taiyuan, which is why the Golden Unity Daoist Tradition has always been so amicable toward us, their influence even faintly visible in numerous grand designs…’

This discovery was not simple, for it represented the potential for further cooperation with the Golden Unity. The inviolable word from an Immortal-level True Monarch Ancestral Master was far more reliable than any promise or ordinary benefit!

‘Could all of this… be related to the origin of that fragment?’

After all, there was also a fragment of the Immortal Artifact within the mountain gates of the Golden Unity!

Now, to find another fragment in the former residence of a True Monarch who followed the same Dao-path as the Golden Unity and was a disciple-brother to Taiyuan—did this mean that the Yanhua Dao-path, the Immortal Zhidu, and the Immortal Artifact were all inextricably linked?

The Li clan had secretly possessed the Immortal Artifact for two hundred years, and the clues found could be counted as next to none. These fragments were scattered east and west without any pattern, so to finally have a clue now made his heart pound with both shock and joy!

He paused for a moment before asking with feigned ignorance, “Forgive my lack of knowledge… but I don’t know what this Grand Culmination of Profound Virtue is…”

Even if Yu Heng had little experience in the mortal world, he knew this was not his place to speak and was struck dumb for a moment. Lu An also began to deliberate, and it was Changyun who finally spoke, saying placidly,

“Though I am a rogue cultivator from Outside the Profound, I have often heard of the 『Profound Monarch of the Serene Two Principles』… As for Grand Culmination, that is a Golden Immortal!”

“As you must know, fellow Daoist, titles like True Monarch do not refer to a specific cultivation level, but rather to the means of one’s Dao-accomplishment and the virtues by which one lives… In ancient times, True Monarch mostly referred to figures who cultivated within Comprehending Profundity, Divine Monarch was typically for those at Encompassing Profundity, while Azure Profundity… was where one found the most Profound Monarchs.”

He said calmly, “Of course, for those figures who could gaze upon the profound, the ancient Three Profundities traditions would usually not make distinctions and would worship them all. There were great figures who embodied all three simultaneously… In later generations, the utterly arrogant Li Qianyuan even gave himself the title Imperial Monarch, which could barely be considered in the same category.”

He made a slight distinction before continuing, “As for Immortal Lord, Grand Culmination, and Golden Immortal, the first is an ancient term while the latter two are modern; these are what refer to a realm. The concept comes from ancient books; in olden times, once one reached this position, not even the heavens would strike Them with the Three Calamities.”

Li Ximing understood perfectly, his heart sinking.

‘In other words, this master of Yanhua once stood at the same position Tianxia is about to reach… To say He was the former master of the Immortal Artifact would not be an overstatement…’

While he was pondering, Lu An clearly did not wish to speak more on the topic, and led them through the corridor of floating green silk draperies and into the main hall. The space instantly brightened, revealing sides that were mottled with age and a plaque hanging from the eaves above the door:

【Wenhuang Residence】!

He forcefully restrained himself from looking up at the eaves, constantly warning himself. ‘If I can’t get it this time, there will be a next. I absolutely cannot reveal the slightest hint of my intentions. If anyone notices anything amiss, I can forget about attaining the Bright Yang Dao and just wait for my entire clan to be exterminated!’

He therefore kept his gaze level, looking at the redwood altar table, behind which the main seat was backed by a wide white wall, mottled at the edges where wood and stone were faintly visible, and on this wall hung a painting.

The painting was simple, containing only hazy ripples of water, and upon them, a single golden lotus that swayed as if it might capsize at any moment. Fierce flames blazed upon the lotus, a palpable heat seeming to rush forth from it. All of its radiance was concentrated within the painting, causing Li Ximing's gaze to fix upon it.

‘This is… the Dao of water and fire…’

Yu Heng bowed. “My master’s lineage comes from Yanhua and possesses the wondrous art of governing yin and yang and balancing water and fire. This painting and this residence are the immortal legacy he left for us descendants to contemplate the Yanhua Dao arts…”

“And my clan’s True Monarch is positioned in the Dui Palace, as the 『True Monarch of the Dui Palace, of Killing and Reaping in the Corner』, with the Dao name 【Taihong】!”

As his voice fell, as if hearing its former master’s name, the unremarkable ink brush that had been resting quietly on the altar table trembled slightly, and the spiritual vitality of the entire courtyard, with its perfect yin-yang balance, was instantly torn to shreds!

Li Ximing finally felt an incomparably sharp aura rush toward him, an impetus that neither yin and yang nor water and fire could halt. All the killing intent was contained within the ink brush on the altar, causing his heart to tremble and the space between his brows to turn icy cold.

‘What a sharp Reflecting Metal qi!’

He marveled to himself. ‘If Senior Lingmei were to enter secluded cultivation here, I’m afraid his Dao-Profundity would soar, and the perfection of his divine abilities would be within reach!’

Fortunately, this Reflecting Metal qi came and went quickly, dissipating like the wind, and only then did Li Ximing step forward quickly, his gaze falling upon the painting, where it remained for a long time before he praised, “Simply wondrous…”

The painting truly held countless mysteries. Even though he had come here with another purpose, upon seeing this profound expression of governing yin and yang and balancing water and fire, he now stood still and began to contemplate it with a clear mind.

His companion, Changyun, was in no better state—the blast of Reflecting Metal qi had moved him deeply, and having gained some insight, he stood rooted to the spot, for a time unable to speak.

In an instant, the only sound in the great, profound residence was the subtle stirring of spiritual vitality. Lu An did not disturb them, turning and clasping his hands behind his back, preparing to exit through the main doors of the hall.

But as he looked at those steps, glowing faintly green in the moonlight, Lu An suddenly stopped. For a moment, a look of confusion entered the eyes of this descendant of the two Lus, and he stared, speechless and with a complex expression, at the green threshold.

An unknown amount of time passed before he raised his head to look at the bright moon outside, and only after a long while did he hear Yu Heng’s voice from within,

“Congratulations, Daoist Master!”

Lu An then strode back inside to find Li Ximing standing in a daze in the center of the room, and he smiled.

“How was it?”

“Profound beyond words!”

This praise from Li Ximing was entirely sincere. His gains had not been small; his movement technique, the 【Tread on Flames】, had benefited greatly, which was certainly an unexpected boon.

Changyun still seemed not to have recovered, remaining silent. Lu An glanced from side to side and smiled.

“In that case…”

“If Suyun weren’t still in the south, I would have insisted she come with me to see this!”

Li Ximing could see that he was preparing to leave for another location. His heart leaped into his throat, but his face showed a look of reluctance. He shook his head, interrupting him. Several ploys flashed through his mind at once before he finally sighed and said,

“It seems to be fate. The master of Yanhua and the current King Wei’s Bright Yang… have a deep connection. When I came here, the King Wei gave me specific instructions. Since there is no trace of Bright Yang in Chun City… I wonder if the Yu clan might possess any related items, or perhaps some traces left by the True Monarch, that you could allow me to see.”

Lu An was taken aback, his mind reeling.

‘That’s right… the current King Wei is entirely a product of Yanhua’s work. No wonder he wanted to come to the 【Wenhuang Residence】 as soon as he arrived!’

It was no surprise that Lu An was slow on the uptake. Of course, those from Chun City knew that Bright Yang had nothing to do with Taihong, but Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei, having come from the distant south, would not necessarily know that!

At these words, Yu Heng became greatly alarmed—he was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He could handle other Purple Mansion cultivators, but the one before him was an imperial descendant of the Bright Yang. Furthermore, his own clan’s Great Daoist Master was serving under King Wei. His resolve was already half-gone, and now his heart was filled with terror.

‘If I handle this poorly, I fear I will bring shame upon the Great Daoist Master in the south!’

“So that’s how it is…”

Though Li Ximing’s gaze was gentle, Yu Heng broke out in a cold sweat. How could he possibly have anything related to Bright Yang! He could only cling to Li Ximing’s words, thinking desperately as he said, “There are, of course, traces of the True Monarch… but this humble cultivator’s status is low, and I dare not move them without permission.”

‘Good boy!’

Li Ximing was well aware that the north was full of hidden masters. He dared not even point at something on the rafters, for who knew if a Grotto-Heaven expert was watching his every move. His internal struggle had been immense, and he had been waiting for just these words!

He smiled and looked at Lu An, who was even more perceptive, and laughed loudly, “Daoist Master Longkang gave instructions long ago! If you’re still worried, you can send someone west and have Daoist Master Yu write you a letter to bring back!”

“This humble cultivator wouldn’t dare!”

He was joking, but Yu Heng was startled and quickly bowed in apology.

“The True Monarch left behind one bamboo slip, one altar, three scrolls, and four talismans. The altar is here, the bamboo slip is in the Great Daoist Master’s possession, one scroll, the 【Water and Fire Golden Lotus Painting】, is already here, and another, the 【Painting of Slaying Demons】, was borrowed by the Purple Terrace when our Daoist tradition fell on hard times and has yet to be returned…”

“There is one more scroll, which must be what the Daoist Master seeks, called the 【Yin-Yang Harmony and Transformation Painting】, but unfortunately…”

He said awkwardly, “Its whereabouts have long been unknown.”

Hearing this, Li Ximing was already secretly thrilled. He watched him with a calm and encouraging expression. Seeing that he did not reply, the young man had no choice but to continue on his own, “As for the three talismans, they have little to do with the Daoist tradition. One has already been used, and of the two remaining, one is in Vast Plateau Heaven being studied by Daoist Master Xu, and one is still here…”

‘Excellent, excellent…’

Li Ximing’s face showed great regret as he sighed, “A pity… truly a pity!”

He then looked around and said, “Since we are here, please let me see this talisman!”

Yu Heng bowed deeply, went to the space below the main seat, and kowtowed three times to the empty position. Only then did he channel his true essence and, under Li Ximing’s regretful gaze, finally retrieve a jade case from the rafters. He held it in both hands and said, “Daoist Master, please look! Be careful of your eyes…”

As a show of respect, Li Ximing accepted it with both hands, seeming to have lost some of his interest. He opened the jade case and felt a surge of Reflecting Metal intent rush over him, making his eyes ache and his face feel as if it were being cut by knives.

He could not even see clearly what was drawn on the talisman paper, only perceiving a field of golden-white light within the case. After a long moment, it slowly subsided, and for some reason, tears began to stream down his face.

But beneath the golden-white light, that small, white fragment entered his spiritual sense. All of Li Ximing’s apprehension and unease finally coalesced, his heart trembling so much he wanted to throw his head back and roar:

‘What a treasure! It’s right here!’

He felt the Talisman Seed in his Shengyang Acupoint continuously release a cooling sensation, terrified of revealing even the slightest clue. He held the jade box further away from himself, covered his eyes, turned his body to the side, and said with a laugh, “Truly powerful!”
