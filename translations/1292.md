# Chpapter 1292: Mount Daling

Li Jiangqian's gaze grew colder at this point. After a long silence, he said,

"The Tantai clan is indeed ancient, with a deep scholarly heritage... I had only heard that with Bright Yang's sudden loss, Emperor Gong passed away, but I didn't know that beneath Taihang..."

He raised an eyebrow and asked, "May I ask... when Emperor Gong died, how did the eastern tour retreat? Who succeeded to the throne?"

Tantai Jin's eyes dimmed slightly, and he replied, "It was a great chaos... a chaos no one could have foreseen. I presume you know that in the Wei-Li Dynasty, officialdom was connected to Bright Yang, and my ancestor, who cultivated as a Woven Jade Immortal, once saw the Wei Emperor's demeanor. He said, 'The Sovereign of the Three Yangs, rarely changes through the ages; ruling the world and controlling Bright Yang binds the world to his very person.' Since something happened to him, nearly seventy percent of the officials experienced a change, and three tenths of those died violently."

"The higher a divine ability cultivator's realm, the less they relied on their official position during cultivation, and the less they were affected. Conversely, others faced a threat to their life-mandate. It wasn't just the Wei Emperor who collapsed and died; the same happened to the accompanying Lords. Two of the Three Ducal Ministers fell, leaving only one Tian Wei. The remaining Left and Right Grand Masters, and the various Ministers of the Grand Secretariat, all fell one by one, spitting blood from severe injuries, and dying within days..."

"At that time, an ancestor of my Tantai clan was in Guanzhong. When he heard of the upheaval, the world was already in great chaos. Although the Crown Prince was still overseeing the state in Guanzhong, he did not proclaim himself emperor, but instead served as the acting Lord of the State..."

He continued forlornly, "After all... no one knew if the next person to ascend the imperial throne would suffer the same fate as Emperor Gong of Wei."

Li Jiangqian's expression was slightly grim. Tantai Jin softly continued,

"My Tantai clan was not deeply involved in the events of that time. However, after Great Liang was established, a Tantai cultivator held a position in court. When the Liang Emperor was compiling the history of the previous dynasty, that ancestor perused one or two scrolls. He returned and once sighed, saying... Bright Yang fell, Hengzhang rose, Spirit's Descent Pass was lost, Youyan rebelled. The Central Monarch perished and fell in Wei Prefecture. Generals from the peasantry suddenly rose in the river valley. The great Jin lands were instantly seized by Qi. The majestic Liao Pass stood firm and refused to submit. Thus, Chongyang died, and Changming perished. Those who invaded Wei from the south were ultimately the Sixteen Jie barbarians... and the lands of the Eastern States were entirely surrendered to the barbarians."

"Gao Xun was loyal and brave, Yin Zheng was wise, both giving their all. Their army crossed Monan. Dao Ping understood the situation, and Cui E was decisive. They dared to lead a host of cultivators and swiftly occupied Mianchi. The people of former Wei still held their ancient lands to prepare for the Jie barbarians' rebellion. The armies marched from the old lands of Yong-Long, vowing to hold the Xiao and Lu mountains, never expecting the Guanqian Profound Dao to be involved..."

"Qi was established but dared not rule the people. An emperor ascended but could not last long. Thus, the world sought change. Though the former Wei had perished, the world had not lost its ruler. Then the meritorious houses were fully re-established, and the Jianghuai region saw several upheavals. It was only after the emperor's collapse that figures like Gao Jun and Pingzhang caused turmoil, reopening Spirit's Descent Pass."

Hearing all of this, Li Jiangqian recognized all the names.

He couldn't help but sneer, saying, "The same acts they performed on stage a thousand years ago are still being played out today."

Tantai Jin gave the Qilin Son a deep look, bowed, and said, "After all, the main players are still here. The Great Ancestor's radiance has not finished its performance. A breath has been reserved for each of the great families, waiting for this song to end."

Li Jiangqian turned his head to look at him.

The Tantai clan had specifically left behind the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure without taking it, which was a small effort on their part. This direct descendant of the Tantai family was quite knowledgeable about the world's situation. Li Jiangqian couldn't help but pay more attention, and softly asked,

"Great Tomb River... does Fellow Daoist Tantai have a mind to explore it?"

Tantai Jin smiled and replied,

"Great Tomb River penetrates deep into the northern region, and is now being coveted by multiple parties, which is rare. Unfortunately, I cultivate Blazing Fire, and my elders at home are not focused on Water Virtue, so we will not get involved—we are simply standing guard here."

"Oh?"

Li Jiangqian questioned with doubt,

"Coveted by multiple parties? Great Tomb River is said to have sustained damage. Can it withstand the duels of so many Daoist Masters?"

This Daoist Master seemed to have anticipated his confusion, and laughed.

"What the Young Master says is true. The Chen clan originally possessed a Grott-Heaven, which was the Great Tomb Heaven of the former Great Tomb Kingdom. Later, an incident occurred, and it was sealed away. Strictly speaking, it is no longer a Grott-Heaven, but a True Monarch's means are profound. They wished to leave behind a heritage, and with a treasure suppressing the interior, it still retains its former majesty."

"As long as the means remain, what are the duels of a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators? Once it is activated by someone, and the heritage within is collected, the rift in the Profound Foundation will connect with the outside, and it will fall into the Underworld sooner or later, even without anyone acting upon it."

Li Jiangqian glanced at the distant Huan Prefecture and chuckled, "I wonder how many powers, and how many Daoist Masters, will venture to this place."

Tantai Jin said in a low voice,

"It looks like quite a few. There is more than one high-level Buddhist cultivator..."

"After all, Daoist Master Xiao is unlike others. He has weathered great upheavals, maneuvering between various powers, and has achieved what he has today on his own. That he can ride the winds of the change of all under heavens makes him no ordinary person... and Great Tomb River is even more extraordinary..."

"And an opportunity like this, related to the Quest for Gold, where one can witness figures at the apex of the world's turmoil seeking the Quest for Gold... some covet the former, while others merely come to observe the verification of the Dao and understand the world's situation to prepare for future needs. I fear that any great master of Water Virtue who harbors the intent of the Quest for Gold will surely come to observe... all the living, counted Great Daoist Masters of Water Virtue will make an appearance."

'Water Virtue cultivators?'

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian felt a bit strange, and his first thought was of a single name.

'Chi Buzi... that specter with the green eyes will probably show up too...'

Tantai Jin's words were half astonishment, half coldness,

"Since these people have come, it's impossible for them to return empty-handed... they look down on the peripheral items, but one can imagine the intensity of the struggle at the very center."

He casually introduced the situation. Li Jiangqian feigned observation, using the conversation as a cover to secretly perform a divination.

Spirit Probe!

A chilling sensation quickly flooded his mind, and his eyes went slightly cold. Li Jiangqian's vision suddenly soared, flying into the boundless heavens, and the distant east changed in an instant.

The Great Void shifted, and a golden light flickered indistinctly. A golden body stood suspended in the sky, reaching deep into the firmament. Its gigantic hands were clasped high up, like white peaks suspended in the Great Void, with clear ridges and valleys.

In the sight of the Immortal Mirror, the Maha behind him was faintly illuminated by the Buddhist Land's radiance, connecting with the sky. It was certainly the Maha Liangli of the Way of Great Desire—Tian Langzhi!

The two Maha golden bodies on the left and right were slightly smaller. One stood on a jackal, and the other held a Profound Jar. They were precisely Renshijia and Xiaodisa!

'The pillars of the Way of Great Desire today...'

For Tian Langzhi, the Maha Liangli, to come with two Dharma Protectors showed the Way of Great Desire's immense seriousness!

Li Jiangqian moved his gaze, as if unaware, and indeed, on the opposite side, he saw an Azure Heaven Bronze chariot floating within the restless, gloomy Exiled Qi, nearly positioned above everyone else, displaying a unique nobility.

Naturally, it was the Underworld!

'Yang Ruiyi's sudden disappearance was indeed to confront them here...'

This northern region, seemingly peaceful, was in fact already bristling with divine abilities and surging with hidden currents!

'Strange...'

His gaze swept the surroundings, and he did indeed see traces of many familiar divine abilities, but after counting, one family was still missing. Doubt arose in his heart.

'This place is right at the gates of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Why is their Maha not present here?'

His eyes were sharp and flickered subtly. He saw the Mount Daling's forests painted in autumn colors, with leaves rustling down, presenting a scene of vibrant life. On a small mountain path, a monk stood!

The monk was clad in black, looking quite young, with a smile on his face. With palms clasped, he quietly strolled through the mountains. While completely integrated with nature, he was like a vivid, intense mirage that immediately captured Li Jiangqian's attention.

Among the Seven Aspects, only the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Pure Unity Dao Gate favored traveling in mortal bodies. The Pure Unity Dao Gate rarely appeared before people, so the monk before him must be a figure from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!

Even stranger was that this Kongshu monk was completely different from the many monks Li Jiangqian had seen!

This man looked like a mortal, but under the sight of the Spirit Probe, a wonderful Buddhist radiance shimmered around him, neither demonic nor evil, pure as snow, connecting heaven and earth, with one thread extending into the infinite Great Void.

A phantom image floated behind him, with light and shadow flowing, and a Bodhi tree swaying. This figure was like a mortal, seated with his chin resting on his hand beneath the Bodhi tree, his face identical to the monk in black!

'Even a Liangli doesn't have this kind of aura!'

Li Jiangqian observed carefully, silently wondering.

'Is it the Golden Land? But even Vast Cicada back then didn't possess this spectacle.'

'So familiar...'

Seeing this monk, he suddenly recalled a Guest Retainer from his childhood family.

'Liaohe Temple... Kongheng!'

This Guest Retainer Kongheng was the first person he saw upon his birth, and he left a profound impression. Back then, this monk was once invited north by the people of the Wrath Dao. The Buddhist Land itself manifested, offering to take him away as the Maha Liangli of the Wrath Dao without requiring him to cultivate... Li Ximing was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm at the time, and the Li family had not truly risen to prominence, yet the shock he left behind is still astonishing today!

'Later, when my two younger brothers were born, both were attended to by him...'

This monk in black was not only similar in demeanor but even had a few similar mannerisms. If Li Jiangqian hadn't personally seen Kongheng, he might have even suspected that this person was that very Guest Retainer!

This Daoist Master Changli's eyes held a hint of contemplation. He then saw the mountain wind rustle, and the monk had already reached the mountain peak, where a table and two chairs were set up. The monk merely brushed his sleeve, and sat down in the cold wind.

His black robe fluttered. Though a monk from the north, he bore no trace of decay or evil, appearing fresh and natural, and his fair face even possessed a sense of handsomeness.

And facing him, a Daoist Master sat opposite.

This man was tall and slender, with a gaunt face, and his two eyes sparkled like stars. He wore an unremarkable Daoist robe, sitting on the mountain peak. Before the table, however, was a golden cup. Seeing the monk in black approach, he smiled and said:

"Fellow Daoist Kongshu!"

This name did not cause much commotion; it seemed the various divine abilities in heaven and earth already knew of this person. However, all eyes converged simultaneously, gathering on this mountaintop, and Li Jiangqian's heart shook.

'Only one character different.'

Li Jiangqian remembered that when Fu Xia, the head of the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple, came to the lake and provoked him with words, Kongheng had mentioned that the abbot of the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple, Fu Xia, was his disciple-brother Kongyan!

'Five of Kongheng's disciple-brothers were lured away. Since they are all of the Kong generation, this Kongshu must be Kongheng's disciple-brother who joined the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!'

Li Jiangqian instantly understood in his heart.

'Back then... if Master Monk Kongheng had nodded, gaining the Manifested Image of a Pure Land Son, seated beneath the rain of Mandarava flowers, he would have been like Kongshu today, with an aura far surpassing a Maha, ranking among the top divine ability cultivators of this realm, perhaps even beyond what a Maha Liangli could achieve...'

'He remained unshakable...'

Li Jiangqian's cultivation was low back then, and even the entire Li family did not fully understand the temptation Kongheng faced—only now did he truly understand how much resolve a Buddhist Master Monk needed to firmly refuse such an opportunity!

He was deep in thought. The monk Kongshu in the mountains returned the greeting, replying,

"Senior Qu."

These two words were as placid as water, yet the Buddhist light of Great Desire that flickered indistinctly in the sky slowly faded. Li Jiangqian, far away, felt a shock in his heart.

'Qu.'

The Li family now understood very well that the Lesser Yang True Monarch once had Dry Yang Abbey, and the people inside were surnamed Qu. The Tao clan's ability to reside long-term in Yinling, feeling superior, and even detaching themselves from the political situation, relied heavily on their connection with the Qu clan!

'I wonder if this Qu is a person from the mountains or a mortal Dao Lineage... ultimately, Great Tomb River is too precious, alarming these people...'

Hearing the monk Kongshu's words, the Daoist Master Qu smiled slightly, his eyes conveying a complex meaning.

He said quietly, "I dare not accept... now Fellow Daoist Kongshu is a 'Pre-Altar, Non-Liangli,' a 'Broad-Aspect, Sandalwood-Clad Son,' a figure before the World Master. How could you call me senior!"

Kongshu seemed a little silent facing him. Hearing this, he gently shook his head and replied,

"Senior Qu is too kind. Separated for a hundred years, Senior's divine ability has become even more vast!"

Daoist Master Qu smiled at him, his gaze enigmatic, and said calmly,

"Not as good as Kongshu."

A strange silence settled between the two, but the subtle, divine power in heaven and earth was intensifying little by little. Finally, a hint of gray color swept over, transforming into a patch of black cloud on the mountaintop.

A long-robed man sat in the cloud, with disheveled hair. His robe was extremely unique, with densely drawn scriptures on both cuffs, impossible to discern whether they were Daoist or Buddhist texts, subtly glowing.

Seeing the divine abilities manifesting one by one, an ominous premonition instantly rose in Li Jiangqian's heart. Just as he was about to look closer, he faintly sensed something. Various divine ability warnings came from his main body, breaking the Spirit Probe in an instant and returning him to his physical self!

"There is also a Great Daoist Master from the Yan Kingdom, named Murong Weidian. He is an accomplished Valley Water cultivator of long standing, and I hear he has no great ambition this time, mainly just to observe Daoist Master Xiao verify the Dao..."

Tantai Jin also paused abruptly, having sensed something. He did indeed see golden light flickering in the Great Void, and a patch of cloud flew over, revealing a dissolute young man in golden robes. The young man clasped his hands slightly and laughed,

"Could this be Daoist Master Changli? What a coincidence!"

Li Jiangqian recognized him immediately.

'Tianhuo!'

'A person from the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition has arrived!'

The contemplative look in his pair of golden eyes flashed away, and a similarly enthusiastic smile immediately appeared on his face. He returned the bow, saying,

"It is Senior Tianhuo!"

This direct descendant of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition came on a golden cloud, and his appearance here could hardly be a coincidence. But before Li Jiangqian could say more, he already approached quite intimately, chuckling.

"I saw Suyun a while ago and felt she had the bearing of a celestial being. I heard that you and your sister are both exceptional talents. Now I see, Changli is indeed a dragon among men!"

His gaze was fervent, and he asked, "May I know... about the matter I raised with Fairy Suyun... how has King Wei considered it?"
