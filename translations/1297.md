# Chapter 1297: Edict Pill

Divine abilities vibrated, and the Pit Water boiled.

The bright jade palace was pristine, yet it was completely inundated by flashing, brilliant multicolored light, as dragon-like and serpent-like forms tumbled along the seabed, while Yu Xi’s gaze was grim, Valley Water swirling around him as he stared at the figure within the dark, murky waters.

This person was holding his large belly with a smile on his face, and riding a cloud behind him stood six Arhats, the flames on his body suppressed to his side by the churning river water, yet still emanating a ferocious might.

‘Beimei…’

This Maha of the Compassion Dao had already lived through four lifetimes and possessed the qualifications to clash with a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but now his prized Molten Fire was being suppressed by this location, while Yu Xi was a veteran Valley Water cultivator, so with one weakened and the other strengthened, he should have been able to defeat his enemy easily.

But the Compassion Dao's Maha truly had some skill, and by relying on those few Arhats to maneuver about, while his own Valley Water was adept at self-preservation rather than offense, they had actually fallen into a temporary stalemate.

The entire sky was filled with the multicolored light of colliding divine abilities, and while he felt vexed, the monk before him was clearly pleased, saying,

“Daoist Friend Yu! You and I have met once before. This grotto-heaven has countless treasures and innumerable palaces all around. Why must you contend with me?”

Yu Xi sneered,

“You destroyed my clan’s great formation and sought to excavate my mystic realm, and you call that 'having met once'? Besides, this formation is enveloped by Valley Water; how could I possibly yield it to you?”

Beimei roared with laughter and said,

“Destroying your great formation was an act of war between two nations, and you were the one who surrendered to the enemy chief first. As for the mystic realm… I sent one or two people over, which can only be considered 'stealing', and the theft wasn't even successful. That White Qilin smashed your mystic realm to smithereens, and yet you don't seem to care about that!”

Yu Xi activated his divine ability, his attacks growing fiercer. He was an old hand, after all, and he replied with a natural, self-righteous expression.

“There will naturally be rewards. How could a creature like you, who respects neither father nor ruler, possibly understand the affairs of the Celestial Dynasty?”

The two fought for a while, and seeing that the number of people nearby was growing, Beimei's heart grew displeased and his attacks became fiercer, but then he heard a tremendous crash as a distant palace suddenly collapsed, violently shooting out three streaks of white light that each fled in a different direction!

The brightest of those lights, however, rushed straight for the two of them, manifesting a form within the river water. It was an ink-black object swirling with dark color, about three fingers wide and shaped like a small snake.

‘Valley Water?!’

In that instant, both men’s expressions changed simultaneously, whether in greed or joy, and they soared up to snatch at the dark object!

Yu Xi cultivated Valley Water, and although he was farther away, he still arrived a step ahead, yet he never imagined that before his hand could even touch the black light, a white light would come speeding over and manifest before him.

Yu Xi only felt his body sink, as if something had crashed aggressively against his forehead, making his head feel like it was splitting apart as his mind instantly fell into darkness.

“Not good!”

Beimei, who was behind him, moved slower and thus escaped the calamity, allowing him to see clearly—what had arrived a step before the white light was a golden ring, etched with bird-seal script inscriptions, its color exceptionally vivid, which had already struck Yu Xi's forehead and caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood!

Beimei’s heart shook.

“Jade Azure Bracelet!”

Sure enough, a wisp of white qi simultaneously drifted over, transforming before him into a man in a wide-sleeved, flowing robe, a gourd tied at his waist and an arm-length stone tablet strapped to his back, appearing as ethereal as an immortal.

He pinched the pitch-black Valley Water object between two fingers, just as Yu Xi’s vision cleared. Recognizing the man before him at a glance, Yu Xi’s soul nearly fled in terror.

“Chiguang!”

The Great Daoist Master of the Overlook Township Pavilion, Chiguang!

This Great Daoist Master Chiguang had been famous for a long time. He was the leader of the Immortal Dao in the Jin territory, and unlike Zhu Kui, who had relied on another path to achieve the status of Great Daoist Master and earned a notorious reputation, Chiguang had friendly relations with both the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Touba family, had been received as a guest of honor by the Han Family on numerous occasions, and was famous for his emotionless pursuit of cultivation…

Most peculiar of all, he cultivated Pure Qi!

‘Although orthodox Pure Qi only involves methods of ingesting qi and nourishing one's nature, his lineage is an unorthodox Daoist art modified by a successor. Its power is nonetheless outstanding, and it can accomplish things many other Dao lineages cannot.’

Calculating their ages, when he, Yu Xi, had achieved the rank of Daoist Master and his reputation was soaring, Chiguang had only just begun cultivating. But as time passed, he truly felt ashamed of his own inferiority compared to this rising star.

Furthermore, Chiguang held an extremely peculiar treasure, and his Valley Water divine ability was not always effective against this Great Daoist Master. Having just taken a blow from the jade bracelet, his heart was now filled with terror. How could he dare to linger? His figure dissolved into various forms of gray water and fled at top speed!

Beimei, however, was momentarily stunned. His Compassion Dao had some dealings with the Overlook Township Pavilion, and a malicious idea immediately struck him. He called out,

“Great Daoist Master! I’ll come help you!”

But he never expected the river water around him to boil and recede rapidly, as if he had been transported to a boundless immortal realm, finding himself surrounded entirely by white light!

‘Crap!’

Sure enough, the distant Daoist Master closed the distance in a single step, his middle-aged face wearing a calm smile, his black beard drifting as he spoke,

“The Maha is too polite!”

His words were gentle, but he had already unbound the stone tablet and brought it smashing down. In an instant, white light surged, spanning the great river and suppressing Beimei!

“Senior Yu cultivates Valley Water and isn't easy to capture, so I must impose on the Maha instead!”

“Rumble!”

The stone tablet descended like a mountain peak, suppressing the seabed as turbulent currents surged everywhere, and the divine abilities scattered.

Such a world-shaking commotion attracted numerous gazes, and in the depths of the sea, white light flowed as faint movements could be detected.

Li Que'wan had been waiting here for a long time.

She controlled the light of the Supreme Yin, remaining motionless and undetected as she quietly watched the struggle in the sky. Only when that stone tablet appeared out of nowhere did her brows slowly furrow.

‘That Great Daoist Master has indeed noticed... this is troublesome…’

It was just as Li Jiangqian had predicted. Li Que'wan had brought Li Zhouwei here at great speed, but they were immediately separated upon entering the grotto-heaven. Because she had arrived a step too late, she almost became the target of everyone upon reaching the river's surface!

Fortunately, she was protected by the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, allowing her to escape unharmed. She descended all the way to the deep river, but many of the profound halls had already been claimed first and concealed with shamanic arts. By relying on Spirit Probe, she managed to find one or two, but she dared not be too obvious, and ultimately continued toward the riverbed.

When she reached the pitch-black riverbed, she finally found a great hall. She managed to open one, only to be discovered by someone else—it was Jian Yan of the Overlook Township Pavilion!

This Daoist Master’s strength was considerable, and Li Que'wan had no desire to get entangled with him, while Jian Yan was not confident he could take her down. The two tacitly agreed to split the findings fifty-fifty and went their separate ways. Li Que'wan then activated Spirit Probe and continued forward until she reached this place.

This bright jade palace was fronted by flowing Valley Water. It was the most magnificent and vast hall in this mountain range, positioned in the center of a cluster of pavilions, its aura splendid. It was also the place Yu Xi and Beimei had been fighting over!

The two had been deadlocked for a long time, unable to open the great formation. Li Que'wan, however, activated Spirit Probe and made an astonishing discovery!

The spiritual items and spiritual resources within the great hall were numerous, a dazzling array, but that was not what truly drew her attention. In the very center was a pool, seemingly calm and waveless, but inside it lay a jade casket, which Spirit Probe enhanced. Li Que'wan could see clearly that within the jade casket was a single pill.

This pill was only the size of a fingertip, entirely pitch-black, and etched with bright, silvery patterns. Although sealed within the jade casket, it still pulsed with an obscure spiritual resonance, as if it might burst out of the casket at any moment.

‘This design… this size…’

Li Que'wan was all too familiar with it; this object was extremely similar to the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill she carried!

‘It’s very likely one of the Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity from the Cavern Reality Platform back then!’

Li Que'wan knew the benefits of the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill better than anyone. Setting other things aside, Li Wushao's current divine ability and the spiritual resonance constantly surging in her own body due to the Profound Coffin Crimson Water were all thanks to this Spiritual Treasure!

‘If I can obtain another one, it will be perfect to use with the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness the family recently acquired!’

Ever since obtaining this Spiritual Treasure, Li Que'wan had made inquiries everywhere but found no trace of others. She understood in her heart that this kind of Spiritual Treasure, which even direct-lineage Golden Core disciples would covet, was most likely collected within various grotto-heavens.

‘Just like how the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill was in the hands of the Yang family.’

Because of this, the desire in Li Que'wan's heart burned even brighter.

‘The possibility of seizing one of the Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity in the outside world is astonishingly low. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!’

Her gaze remained fixed on that entirely black, silver-patterned Spiritual Treasure. Even though a Great Daoist Master had now appeared, she remained cautiously hidden in the distance, waiting quietly.

‘Although Chiguang has arrived… there might still be a chance… moreover…’

A look of delighted surprise appeared in her eyes.

The entire battlefield, awash with flowing light, gradually quieted down. One gaze after another shot toward this location. Daoist Master Chiguang remained unperturbed. Amidst the Maha's continuous pleas for mercy from below, he collected several spiritual items before casually letting him go. With his other hand, he made a pinching gesture in the void, retrieving the jade bracelet into his grasp.

“Rumble!”

The storm at the riverbed exploded once more, and boundless power swept out. Finally, with a crisp crack, the great formation shattered under the watch of numerous divine abilities!

Chiguang, however, did not move forward. His eyes suddenly narrowed, and he raised one hand, pinching two fingers together, having already caught something.

This object was an iron-green copper sword, covered in dense, profound patterns, looking as if it were mottled with rust. It had a golden tassel and emitted a strong, dark light.

It was the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword!

The person who had arrived was impressively the northern rogue cultivator, Zhu Kui!

In that instant, divine abilities from all sides, like starving wolves sensing blood, swarmed forward, pouring collectively into the shattered main hall!

This Zhu Kui was truly insidious. He didn't move himself but instead hid to the side, deliberately obstructing Chiguang to draw in the other powers. As long as Chiguang was temporarily blocked, he certainly wouldn't be able to claim all the benefits, and Zhu Kui could then just turn around and chase those who had obtained treasures.

This Great Daoist Master clearly saw his intention, but it was already too late. Even if that bright jade palace could accommodate a few divine ability cultivators, it couldn't withstand such a pincer assault, and it immediately shattered!

“Rumble!”

In an instant, countless white lights shot skyward. Some were divine abilities that had snatched treasures and were fleeing, some were Spiritual Artifacts and Spiritual Treasures with spirits of their own, scattering and escaping. There were also rows of pavilions that came crashing down like a landslide, smashing in all directions. Most of it was the wreckage of collapsed profound halls, tumbling to the riverbed.

‘A good chance!’

Li Que'wan's gaze had been locked on the center of the hall, and now, without hesitation, she stepped through the void, landing on the hall's foundation.

The hall’s dome had already been blown off, leaving only ruins. Amidst the earth-shaking tremors, the Valley Water in that pool erupted outward, nearly emptying it and revealing the jade casket at the bottom!

But at this very moment, another burst of golden light surged forth. Someone else struck with extreme speed, using the cover of the divine abilities to target the same jade casket.

This person was dressed in golden robes, appeared rather old, and had a calm gaze. He seemed to be a Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect!

This old man's divine ability was profound. He had been a three-ability cultivator for many years and also cultivated escape arts. His movements were naturally not something a Whole Pill cultivator could compare to. Although Li Que'wan had the Subduing Creek Splitting Light Lotus, that item was for escaping predicaments, and for a moment she was too slow to stop him.

But just as his hand was about to grasp the jade casket, the seawater boiled, and a crimson light shot through the void, smashing toward the golden-robed cultivator!

Great Radiance Golden Splendor.

It was Li Jiangqian.

The siblings needed no communication. Li Jiangqian knew what Li Que'wan needed. Although he was far away and couldn't make it in time, he had already prepared the spell art in advance, waiting for this very moment!

The Daoist Master’s expression changed abruptly, and he was forced to raise his hand, summoning a Spiritual Artifact to block. It was indeed a brilliant golden light, truly extraordinary. This Daoist Master was none other than Chunshuo!

“Senior… my apologies!”

Li Que'wan naturally recognized him as someone from the Golden Feather Sect, and out of respect for the relationship between their two families, she offered a soft apology, but she absolutely could not yield on a fated opportunity and a heavenly treasure. Her eyes shone as she ruthlessly reached out to snatch it.

Chunshuo seemed to recognize the woman before him. Hearing her soft-spoken words, he was quite surprised, and a trace of hesitation flashed in his eyes.

But as the three of them vied for it, the jade casket suddenly flipped over, slipping from her divine ability's grasp like a cunning fish, and shot toward the surface like a bolt of lightning!

Li Que'wan and Chunshuo looked up at the same time, only to see a middle-aged man standing in the void above, his expression serene. One hand was at his chest, the other held forward, as if holding an invisible fishing rod, tightly locking onto the jade casket!

‘The Pit Water Life Divine Ability, Man on Creek!’

This familiar Life Divine Ability was executed brilliantly, fast and precise, speeding toward the surface. However, a black-robed man with a grim expression condensed his form midway, accurately seizing the jade casket.

Li Wushao!

Although the jade casket was made of good material, it couldn't withstand being fought over by so many divine abilities, and it finally shattered with a bang, revealing the black-bodied, silver-patterned Spiritual Treasure within!

Upon seeing Li Wushao, this Spiritual Treasure acted with great affinity, landing gently in his hand, which made Li Que'wan’s eyes brighten instantly.

‘It really is one of the Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity!’

Li Que'wan had known all along that he was waiting to ambush it. Her heart burned as she soared up to rendezvous with Li Wushao, while her brother's figure also materialized at her side. His urgent voice already reached her ear,

‘Leave, quickly! Something is wrong here!’

Li Jiangqian’s gaze hadn't even landed on the people nearby. Instead, he was staring fixedly at the ruins beside the pool, where a painting still hung stubbornly on a fragmented stone wall.

In the painting, great waters surged, a Dragon King was faintly visible within the rain, and a figure stood in the sky with his hands behind his back, looking exceptionally profound. Endless lightning flashed, and the great waters were slowly beginning to surge.

But unlike last time, this painting was densely marked with Cinnabar brushstrokes and suppressed by a black talisman.

Combining this with the utter devastation of the previous hall, while this place remained remarkably intact, Li Jiangqian suddenly understood:

‘This scene, it must be Dongfang Heyun! The Dragon-kin have hidden agents in this grotto-heaven, ready to go out and interfere with the situation at any time… only to be thwarted by the measures left by the grotto-heaven's original cultivators… Something went wrong at my location, which was already unsealed, but the others are still sealed…’

‘The source of the Dragon Monarch’s power projection is this painting!’

He was already sharp, and with the Spirit Probe perspective, he saw everything clearly and had a deep intuition, understanding it all in an instant.

‘Each of those paintings is like an opening, transmitting the power of the Dragon-kin. Dongfang Heyun… can probably exit from here too!’

Li Que'wan also sensed the intense danger coming from this seemingly ordinary painting. She immediately turned to leave, taking the jade casket from Li Wushao, only to find her gaze meeting a pair of eyes in the distance.

Those eyes were slightly narrow, imbued with a pale white divine ability, and as they blinked, they filled with a surging, delighted surprise.

Chiguang.

A fervent heat faintly appeared in the Great Daoist Master’s gaze, his expression somewhat astonished.

‘This is bad!’

A chill instantly ran through Li Que'wan.

A great cultivator like Chiguang couldn't possibly be unaware of the world-famous Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity, and there was no way he wouldn't be tempted!

Earlier, the jade casket was intact. Li Que'wan believed the Golden Feather Daoist Master had definitely sensed something and come specifically for it. Neither of them had broken the casket precisely because they feared attracting attention. But the Pit Water Daoist Master in the sky, acting on a whim, didn't understand the gravity of the situation. Now that it was broken and its aura exposed, it had immediately drawn the Great Daoist Master's attention!

An icy chill shot to her mind. She unhesitatingly activated the profound art, pressing her palms together as a glazed lotus flower materialized, scattering a clear light.

Subduing Creek Splitting Light Lotus.

This profound art showed its might for the first time, erupting with tens of thousands of rays of Valley Water light, but the distant Great Daoist Master remained unhurried. His lips moved, his gaze fixed on her, as if he chanted two words.

The unfurling Valley Water lotus froze for an instant, but it broke through the seal and had already enveloped the woman’s body, preparing to flee at top speed!

‘Hm?’

A flicker of surprise passed through the distant man's eyes.

When Xuanyi had come to the mountain back then, he had mentioned this Spiritual Artifact. This item was extremely domineering; although it had a long cooldown, it was nearly impossible for most divine abilities to suppress. Now, it had finally shown its divine effect!

But that streak of light had only just risen when the distant Great Daoist Master simultaneously vanished, his form drifting like a cloud. He pinched a round bead in his hand, which emitted a multicolored, wondrous azure light, and intoned,

“Stay!”

Such bright and beautiful Valley Water actually slowed for an instant when faced with the Pure Qi in his hand. It couldn't fly far before it was bound in place. In the blink of an eye, the situation had deteriorated drastically. A shadow fell over Li Jiangqian’s eyes, and terror struck his heart.

‘Pure Qi!’

The treasure in this Great Daoist Master's hand was actually an extremely rare Pure Qi object!

And in just that single instant of stagnation, the stone tablet from the heavens was already smashing down with infinite power. He was a dignified Great Daoist Master, yet he showed absolutely no mercy in dealing with a cultivator who had just entered the Purple Mansion Realm!

But a golden light surged up, materializing into a small, exquisite pearl, its power immense, calming a whole region of the river as it drifted up to block the stone tablet, causing Chiguang’s expression to change for the first time.

‘Heart-Resonance Precious Pearl! Golden Oneness?’

Sure enough, beneath that dazzling golden light, a man stood with his hands behind his back, his expression serene.

It was Chunshuo!

Because he had much contact with the outside world, this old Daoist Master who had come from the Azure Revolution Heaven was one of the few Golden Feather Daoist Masters who approved of Li Que'wan verifying the Dao. He was advanced in years and had no hope of advancing his Dao, nor did he need to watch over descendants. His entry into this place this time was not driven by strong ambition. It was partly to glimpse the mysteries of the Five Edots of Hidden Profundity and partly to observe the changing tides of the world.

Such an old Daoist Master acted as he pleased, and seeing Li Que'wan as half one of his own, he had hesitated during the scramble. Now, at this moment, he had actually stepped forward!

Chiguang was actually an extremely calm person. If it had been any other treasure, faced with the Li family and Golden Oneness at the same time, he, even as a Great Daoist Master, would naturally have taken a step back…

‘But that is one of the Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity!’

His eyes held not a trace of emotion as he raised his hand and shook his sleeve,

“Huala!”

His sleeve abruptly burst open, and an infinite amount of seawater surged in, enveloping the woman from afar, draining away every inch of space around her, causing Li Que'wan’s expression to change slightly.

‘Sleeve Residence Art!’

Her figure instantly froze in place, and as clouds gathered, the Great Daoist Master actually walked right out from in front of her.

‘Floating Cloud Body…’

Just as the surrounding scenery dissolved, about to transform into an endless, ethereal world of clouds and mist, the middle-aged Daoist Master strode calmly through the void, the jade bracelet in his hand circling continuously.

The Great Daoist Master before her gave her no chance to hesitate. The jade bracelet was already speeding toward her, smashing down at her face.

“I will give Golden Oneness and King Wei face. Leave the item, and I will not pursue matters with you!”

Her expression was grave, all her divine abilities condensing. Without hesitation, she threw the Spiritual Treasure in her hand, sinking into the ethereal seawater just before the cloudy world closed completely!

Li Que'wan was actually not panicking excessively. She had cultivated to this day, but her trump card, Scattering White Falling Feather, remained unused, which could allow her a temporary escape. But whether she carried this edict pill or not would determine if this Great Daoist Master would continue to make things difficult for her.

As a one-ability cultivator, she absolutely could not survive being hunted by a Great Daoist Master!

But as long as the treasure wasn't left in the grotto-heaven, or lost to someone unknown—as long as she knew who obtained it—whether by trade or by force, with Li Zhouwei around, she would one day get it back!

Li Que'wan felt a biting chill, as if surrounded by infinite killing intent. She unhesitatingly pushed the Spiritual Treasure from her hand, and the jade bracelet abruptly lessened its force. Even so, taking the blow to her head, she still coughed up a mouthful of blood, finally falling out of that ethereal, cloudy world!

The familiar riverbed reappeared before her. She landed right in front of the Valley Water pool. Chiguang, however, was already lunging forward without obstruction, about to grasp the Spiritual Treasure, but unexpectedly, another shadow came smashing toward him!

Chiguang, a dignified Great Daoist Master, actually felt a momentary sense of danger. He immediately retracted all his divine abilities, pinching two fingers in front of him, cautiously stopping the shadow.

It was a painting.

In the painting, great waters surged, a Hornless Dragon churned within the rain, the figure in the sky had vanished, the Cinnabar marks had faded, and endless lightning flashed, striking dark cracks across the image. The water in the painting was already churning, as if about to burst forth!

Not far away, Li Jiangqian, who had casually tossed the black talisman, his eyes filled with ruthless spite, was helping his sister up, preparing to flee on his divine ability!

His original intention was to snatch the treasure and leave immediately, but he hadn't expected this Great Daoist Master to interfere, and his sister had been trapped within a divine ability. With his personality, how could he let this go!

‘Might as well let Dongfang Heyun intervene!’

Although Dongfang Heyun acted as if he had friendly dealings with the Li family, things changed rapidly within a grotto-heaven. Li Jiangqian had never counted on this person's friendship, but in the current situation, with his sister trapped, he might as well help the Dragon-kin one more time!

Although Chiguang didn't know his intention, he knew this was nothing good. His face slowly darkened, and he said coldly,

“Such audacity!”

Li Jiangqian didn't look back, just about to pull his sister away to avoid being caught in the battle between the two, when he realized the woman had suddenly frozen, grabbing his robe, her voice trembling slightly.

“Brother!”

Li Jiangqian’s pupils shrank instantly.

The painting, frozen in mid-air, trembled violently, erupting with a tsunami-like roar and the extreme boom of thunder. Below it, golden profound characters flashed into existence, one by one:

**Water Descends, Thunder Rises.**

Dongfang Heyun's figure did not step out from it. Instead, an extremely dense lightning-light did. Chiguang’s gaze grew progressively colder, and all the structures beneath his feet transformed into a calm, mirror-like lake of boiling purple lightning.

Li Que'wan wiped the blood from her crimson lips. The light in her eyes was bright, reflecting a profound spear that was angled toward the ground, its blade as flat as buckwheat, while her tranquil, clear voice, like a pure spring, caused heaven and earth to brighten:

“Your courage is certainly not small, Daoist friend.”
