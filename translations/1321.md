# Chapter 1321: Two Assistants

The sky remained dim and dark. Qiao Wenliu and Yehui huddled together, talking for a while. Cups and vessels passed back and forth, and before they realized it, several hours had slipped by. Yet the more they pushed through scenarios and calculated the situation, the murkier it appeared.

"Yan Kingdom and Gu Prefecture are both formidable enemies. Our side is weak. If King Wei wants to advance, he must use one weak force to contend with two strong ones—truly difficult beyond measure..."

Yehui's brow furrowed tightly. Before he could say more, Qiao Wenliu before him suddenly raised his head. Light and color flowed as he connected with the great formation, and an image materialized—a divine ability user approaching from outside the prefecture, expression hurried, riding a azure carriage.

"Sima Yuanli has arrived!"

Yehui laughed. Qiao Wenliu's spirits remained low.

Yehui had revealed something of the southern forces' true depth to him, but no matter how he calculated, none of it added up. Resisting Yan Kingdom alone would be difficult—how much more so conquering Gu Prefecture as well? His life and fortune stood on the front line. Naturally, suspicion arose.

'I offer my sincere assistance, yet does King Wei not trust me...'

When he saw that only a second-stage divine ability user of Upright Wood had come, his regard dropped further. He had no great enthusiasm to personally welcome the visitor and merely opened the formation, dispatching someone to greet him.

This Daoist Master Qinghu acted naturally enough. In moments, he reached the great hall, striding inside. Seeing Yehui, his expression cooled slightly, but each performed their courtesies and exchanged Daoist titles with this Daoist Master Qiao. Daring not delay, he declared,

"Two Daoist Masters! Joyous news!"

"Oh?"

Qiao Wenliu barely raised his eyelids, those eyes fixing on him. Yehui wore an expression of mild interest. Sima Yuanli smiled and said,

"Daoist Master Changyun's divine abilities are vast! He struck unexpectedly—the Daoist Master guarding Guangping Prefecture abandoned the formation and fled. We've already taken Guangping! Along with it, we've accepted the surrender of the rogue Daoist Master within the city... Now Daoist Master Yu and Daoist Master Liu have both arrived. The rear is secure!"

He sighed and continued,

"Alas, this commotion was too great. Wei Prefecture was seized by Yan Kingdom's defending general Liang Jushi..."

Hearing this, a flash of disappointment crossed Qiao Wenliu's eyes.

Sima Yuanli had just arrived and didn't understand the situation. But how could this local power not know? Guangping's great formation rivaled the fortifications of Yun and Pu—what sort of Daoist Master, if not King Wei himself, could break through so quickly? With a moment's calculation, he understood.

'Gu Prefecture clearly abandoned Guangping, handing over this strategic point willingly to force us to face Yan Kingdom in the north, ensuring we cannot attend to both ends... If King Wei hadn't laid plans in advance, if Xun Tiao—a decent man stationed there who refused to let immortal lands become Buddhist territory—hadn't abandoned the city early, Guangping would have required a hard-fought battle!'

He laughed coldly,

"That pack of self-righteous hypocrites in Gu Prefecture have always worn masks of virtue. Wei Prefecture has colluded with the north for years—losing it is no great matter. But Guangping they dare not easily surrender. Throwing it into our hands means if we one day lose to Yan Kingdom and the hundreds of thousands of citizens within convert to Buddhism, who bears that karmic burden? Fellow Daoist Qinghu is far too pleased with himself!"

Sima Yuanli was no fool. After a moment's consideration, he grasped the current situation. His smile faded, replaced by solemnity. Then he heard Yehui rise and bow deeply, saying,

"King Wei!"

Indeed, brightness filled the great hall. The ink-robed young man had already stepped inside, his golden eyes brilliant, like Mount Taishi itself, suppressing all directions and calming the restless atmosphere throughout the main hall.

Seeing him appear, Sima Yuanli relaxed slightly. He performed a courtesy and transmitted through divine ability,

'I report to King Wei: The Monarch has mobilized troops. He dispatches Daoist Master Lin to lead the Holders of the Profound northward from Jianghuai, advancing from where thr Great General is stationed, straight to Juan City...'

'The forces of the Wei Court... are also led by Daoist Master Zhaojing and will arrive at Dangyin shortly.'

These two forces combined mobilized nearly half the south's total strength, leaving only Chen Yin, Ning Wan, Tinglan, and a handful of others with a small contingent of Holders of the Profound to maintain defense. This revealed the depth of their commitment.

Once these two armies entered Dangyin together, with Yan Kingdom unable to split its attention, even without Li Zhouwei present, the certainty of holding this position would be extremely high!

'Unfortunately... if a Great Daoist Master led the way, never mind holding this position—we could directly counterattack Gu Prefecture without question.'

The Song Court actually still had that Sword Immortal who hadn't been mobilized. If he could travel north alongside Li Zhouwei, the Yun and Pu barriers would crumble in an instant...

'Regrettably, Jianghuai stands empty. This Sword Immortal serves as the greatest trump card guarding Jianghuai—even an implied key piece reaching tacit understanding with multiple powers. He cannot possibly go north...'

Li Zhouwei's thoughts surged like tides. Sima Yuanli paused, then said,

'The south... harbors some criticism. There are even those who claim King Wei engages in reckless militarism... They've been demoted to the Southern Borderlands by the Monarch.'

King Wei nodded, understanding in his heart.

Clearly, this second wave of reinforcements came from new orders by the Song Emperor, once again bypassing the Yang clan. Inevitably, this left them somewhat flustered and quite dissatisfied. He said nothing more and asked,

"Has Daoist Master Liu arrived?"

Sima Yuanli nodded.

"He and Daoist Master Yu await outside."

Li Zhouwei's heart eased slightly. He turned to look at Qiao Wenliu and spoke quietly,

"Daoist Master Qiao, remain a moment longer. Everyone else, please withdraw."

Instantly, the divine ability users dispersed. The hall doors thundered shut. Qiao Wenliu paused, startled, then bowed and said,

"King Wei, this is..."

The young man swept his robes and already sat in the primary seat, looking at him with a smile,

"At such a critical juncture, I should by rights have Daoist Master Qiao guard Juan City. But recalling your sincere devotion yesterday, since you harbor ambitions to make your name and establish your reputation—would you be willing to journey eastward?"

"Eastward?"

The expression in Qiao Wenliu's eyes crystallized momentarily. In that instant, multiple considerations surged through his mind, and he immediately had his answer,

'This must be to bypass the barrier and break the siege!'

Logically speaking, his roots lay in Juan City. Though the Qiao family was substantial, those Qiao Wenliu held dear numbered only a handful—that was secondary. But the great formation, his spiritual roots within this prefecture, his cave dwelling—these were all precious possessions!

'Especially... my beautiful darlings...'

If even one of these beauties perished, Qiao Wenliu would slap his thigh in anguish. Should Juan City fall, casualties would be incalculable—not to mention the trouble of finding another territory under his control to settle all these swallows and warblers...

Yet Li Zhouwei's meaning had been revealed, setting Qiao Wenliu's heart stirring.

'Cowering in Juan City, taking blows—how suffocating! What benefits could I possibly gain? How could it compare to striking east while feinting west, following King Wei to reap massive rewards!'

More importantly, was King Wei truly asking about his current choice? Clearly, he was pointing out a path for his future!

After much consideration, he said,

"King Wei treats me with sincerity. How could Qiao refuse!"

He raised his hands and bowed, sighing:

"However... there is one matter I must entreat of King Wei..."

Li Zhouwei smiled:

"Would it concern your Qiao family's direct descendants?"

This guess was naturally accurate. After all, though formations and such were precious, they were merely matters of profit. As long as the eastern harvest proved large enough, losses could be compensated. But if people died, they were truly dead. Naturally, they must be moved first to resolve his worries about what he'd leave behind!

Qiao Wenliu chuckled and said carefully,

"Not only that... not only. I have eighty-nine beautiful concubines, each a treasure I hold dear. I must ask King Wei to arrange for them first—no need to send them too far, just find some accommodating... nearby territory. When I return in triumph, I can still go comfort their hearts..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a wry smile.

After all, the pressure of remaining here was great. The personnel for this journey shouldn't be numerous, but must be carefully selected.

Going east was a detour fraught with danger and without a path of retreat. Once something happened, it was extremely likely they would fall into a perilous situation...

Among the cultivators, in terms of self-preservation, naturally Yu Xi ranked first—a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Valley Water. But while this person excelled at self-preservation, his offensive capabilities were lacking. Should any major battle truly arise, he would likely prove inadequate.

'Without Qiao Wenliu, this would be somewhat difficult to manage. But this person's Lesser Yin divine ability is formidable—he can retreat to preserve himself and advance to slay enemies. With such high Dao-Profundity, he's an extremely suitable choice!'

Moreover, this person coveted wealth and possessed considerable daring. Juan City, along with his descendants and beautiful concubines, already rested in Li Zhouwei's hands—this added another layer of assurance for the eastern journey.

Besides this, Li Zhouwei had long contemplated the second candidate.

Removing a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator already left Juan City appearing empty. Naturally, he couldn't also take away combat power like Yehui and Changyun who could stand their ground before a Great Daoist Master. The second candidate should primarily serve as support...

'This person must possess the ability to preserve themselves and withdraw in great battles, while also providing assistance from the side—ideally with exquisite methods capable of influencing even Great Daoist Masters.'

One name naturally emerged.

Liu Changdie!

This Senior Liu was the most trustworthy of his own people. He had also cultivated both Vault Metal and Harmonising Metal—two Dao lineages already severed in the present world. Speaking of their profound mysteries, even Gu Prefecture's Daoist Masters would likely be completely ignorant!

'And in his hands... he still holds the [Profound Vault Invitation Letter].'

This Vault Metal Spiritual Treasure possessed world-shaking power. Years ago, it had even allowed Liu Changdie to depart calmly from a joint attack by two sixth-generation Maha without the slightest injury. Wasn't he the most suitable candidate?

'And his [Profound Vault Invitation Letter] holds profound mysteries. He and Quewan researched it together and claimed it could influence Spiritual Artifacts, lending me aid. Though it hasn't been used in these recent battles, it surely won't disappoint...'

His calculations complete, he smiled.

"Let us go, Daoist Master Qiao!"

Qiao Wenliu bowed with a smile and together they proceeded outside the great hall. All divine ability users gathered. King Wei swept his gaze across the cultivators and spoke softly,

"Jiangqian!"

The crimson-robed man stepped forward composedly.

"You shall lead the defense here and hold fast with all your strength... for at least... ten days."

Facing the assembled divine ability users, Li Jiangqian showed no fear. He bowed and nodded, smiling.

"I will ensure Father has no worries!"

Li Zhouwei then called both Sima Yuanli and Yehui forward. His tone carried an added weight of solemnity.

"Changli is young. For matters here, I must trouble you two Daoist Masters to exert yourselves fully."

Yehui remained as impassive as ever, returning the courtesy with a smile. Sima Yuanli, however, appeared quite ashamed. He sighed deeply, his expression earnest.

"King Wei saved my life—how could I not repay this debt! Please, King Wei, do not worry. Even if I must reveal every trump card today, I will hold Juan City for King Wei!"

......

Lotus Temple.

Above, the tall temple gleamed gold and brilliant. Layer upon layer of candles arranged in high tiers flickered beneath the night sky. Scarlet candle tears flowed down, following the golden steps in cascading streams like blood and tears.

Directly facing the great hall, incense smoke rolled thick. Milky white liquid rippled in a pool, reflecting the youth at the shore—lips red and teeth white, pacing endlessly back and forth at the pool's edge, paper and brush in hand, appearing quite anxious.

His gaze swept across the writing in his hand.

'Our Dao has cultivated for many years, repeatedly oppressed by the Jiang clan... Today, humbly receiving heavenly grace, we only hope for the auspicious unicorn's tread. Our entire Lotus Temple, from top to bottom, gazes distantly with reverence... wishing King Wei... success in his endeavors...'

He added a few characters, then dissatisfied, scraped them away again, scratching his ears and cheeks. Finally, footsteps sounded from below. Maha Mingmeng entered quickly, his face full of contemplation.

"Junior brother..."

Seeing his junior brother's ear-scratching, cheek-rubbing appearance, he seemed to have anticipated this long ago and smiled.

"You're writing to that King Wei!"

Minghui shook his head and sighed,

"I'm merely thinking it through."

"I think you're doing more than thinking."

Minghui cursed inwardly but merely sighed aloud,

"Senior brother speaks correctly. But in this north-south conflict fought to this point, such a thing has never occurred before. I cannot set this precedent. This letter is also difficult to send! Only you and I remain here. I cannot discuss this with others..."

Aside from Minghui and Mingmeng, all other Maha from Lotus Temple had gone to Great Tomb River, led by his master Jinlian with full force—the calculations behind this were exceedingly complex!

His master Jinlian calculated thus:

'King Wei's prestige grows ever greater. His next step will certainly covet eastern territories, inevitably bringing fundamental conflict with our Way of Joyful Bliss... Since this is so, how can we sit idle and await destruction?'

'Naturally, we must act before King Wei and cripple ourselves first! Otherwise, how can we escape this entanglement!'

In external wars like the north-south conflict, Joyful Way never competed. But the Great Tomb River matter qualified as internal strife—Lotus Temple had truly exerted twelve-tenths of its energy!

Now Li Zhouwei had suddenly moved north. Minghui sensed this, but with the outcome at Great Tomb River still undecided, with Mingxiang and his master Jinlian both absent, at such an excellent opportunity, he actually had no one to consult.

Mingmeng glanced at him, understanding his master's attitude toward King Wei, and thus considered.

"Sending a letter would likely leave a handle in Mount Dayang's grasp—unwise to act rashly... Moreover... Master has always maintained good relations with the immortal families. Though we've had some friction with the Jiang clan here, there's no great enmity..."

Minghui sighed,

"I regret precisely this! I never imagined King Wei would act so swiftly. Had I anticipated this... I would have long ago found cause to antagonize Gu Prefecture, rather than remain inactive!"

Mingmeng found this somewhat strange,

"Junior disciple regards this too heavily. We simply won't provoke him... There's no need to..."

"Bah!" Minghui said, "He's a Great Daoist Master! Senior disciple!"

Though this monk's heart brimmed with schemes, his analysis of the situation proved quite logical. He merely said,

"Once Gu Prefecture is resolved, who comes next? As long as Gao Fu doesn't die, the Gao family will certainly not turn against him—they might even be used by him. Then we'll be caught between Wei and Song. If we don't establish more favorable relations now, who knows what fate awaits us later!"

Mingmeng's brow furrowed sharply. Looking at the letter his junior disciple handed over, his expression transformed dramatically.

At court, Mingmeng had relentlessly bitten at Jiang Toushou, thinking his attitude sufficiently obsequious. Yet now, reading his junior disciple's letter, he found it astonishing—only now understanding what true sycophancy meant. He couldn't help but say,

"This letter you've written makes it seem you're also surnamed Li!"

Minghui shook his head repeatedly, yet inwardly grumbled:

'How could it be otherwise? Your master is also surnamed Li. Everyone in this Lotus Temple from top to bottom—even the barley in those temple fields—should all be surnamed Li...'
