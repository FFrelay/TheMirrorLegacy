# Chapter 1288: Destined Opportunity

The Eastern Sea surged with boundless waves.

White qi rolled across Pure Unity Island, resembling a fairyland, as numerous cultivators moved through the tranquil scene.

A heavy snow filled the sky. A white-robed cultivator sat atop a broken peak, silently facing the chessboard before him. At the other end, a man in green robes quietly watched him.

Ever since Martial Grand-ancestor Daoist Master Yuanshang perished while verifying the Dao, crashing into and shattering Seajade Peak and leaving behind this half-seat Jade Terrace Mountain, the spiritual qi of this place had changed year by year. The snowfall grew heavier, spreading down the mountain.

The mountain's summit was even more frigid. An unknown amount of time passed before someone was seen descending by treading on the air. It was a Daoist holding a small pagoda, his movements proper, his expression serious and meticulous.

Seeing him, Che Hong hurriedly rose.

"Grandfather!"

This person was precisely Che Hong's grandfather, a Mansion Water cultivator of the Pure Unity Dao Gate, Daoist Master Guanghou!

Back then, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had been powerful and flourishing, while the Pure Unity Dao Gate was suffering a gap in talent. By the time the Supreme Yang lost its radiance, the Pure Unity Dao Gate instead experienced a great blossoming of the Immortal Dao unseen in centuries. Yuanshang and Fuxuan led the way, followed by Guanghou and Che Hong, this pair of grandfather and grandson blessed with outstanding talent!

Now, Daoist Master Guanghou, who had been in seclusion for many years, had appeared in the mountains at some unknown time. The green-robed Daoist Master quickly rose, followed suit with a salute, and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist Guanghou, it has been too long!"

Guanghou sat down but did not look directly at him. Instead, his gaze fell upon the chessboard as he replied,

"Fellow Daoist Si... I suppose I should call you Fellow Daoist Sima now. You are quite different from before."

He paused slightly.

"Congratulations."

Hearing Guanghou's words, Sima Yuanli smiled,

"I cannot compare to Fellow Daoist Guanghou."

The age difference between Guanghou and Sima Yuanli was only a few decades, yet the gap was considerable. The Sima Family was sparse in numbers, and Daoist Master Yuanxiu had actually been waiting all along for a worthy talent to cultivate, but repeatedly failed to find one. Sima Yuanli was like the tallest picked from Yuanxiu's short selection, a helpless move born of no alternative... to the point that he was only given heavy responsibility after reaching a considerable age.

But Guanghou had been a genius who alarmed the ancestors ever since the Qi Refining realm. He was once regarded by Fuxuan as a future pillar of the sect and carefully nurtured. He had not disappointed, achieving the Purple Mansion Realm in extremely short order. Before him, Sima Yuanli inevitably seemed somewhat overshadowed.

Guanghou frowned and said,

"The Daoist Master is in seclusion. Your message was sent in; I have read it..."

A trace of coldness entered his gaze as he spoke quietly:

"After all, regarding the events at Ridge-crossing Peak, there are many things that are inconvenient to discuss."

Sima Yuanli remained silent.

Ever since Daoist Master Xianyao perished, Ridge-crossing Peak had been offered to Yang Song by Cheng Qian. The Great Song's forces had been coming and going from Ridge-crossing Peak ever since, first the Lingu family, and later the Chen Clan...

"It was better in previous years. But recently, King Wei pacified Luoxia and moved from Xiang to Huai. The north is disaffected, possessing neither the will to fight nor any benefits to fight for. They are unexpectedly meek, not daring to strike back, only making token gestures of skirmishing."

His gaze was distant as he said,

"For Fellow Daoist Sima to come now, it seems the Emperor has set his sights on Pure Unity."

Even if the Yang Clan truly held this intention, Sima Yuanli could not admit it on their behalf. He rose, waved his hand, and replied,

"Fellow Daoist misunderstands. This is regarding the matter of the Great Tomb River..."

"Oh?"

Guanghou raised an eyebrow at him and replied,

"Why do you say so?"

Sima Yuanli said quietly,

"The Xi Clan once resided in Jianghuai. As prominent families of Jiangbiao, if there are changes in the Great Tomb River, how could the Xi Clan be absent? The Chen Clan's foundation was in the Great Tomb Kingdom, which contains the Daos of Pit Water and Mansion Water. The Emperor's heart is benevolent; in sending King Wei to pacify Luoxia, is this not a destined opportunity for the Daoist Master's foundation in achieving the Dao?"

Guanghou fell silent.

In truth, Sima Yuanli was not wrong. The Great Tomb River was by no means lacking in treasures of Pit Water and Mansion Water. It was also rumored to be a place where one could verify the Dao, a rare ancient location. Logically, any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of these two Daos, as long as they had the heart for verifying the Dao, could not possibly stay away.

His, Guanghou's, talent was not low, and he had the rare fortune of being born at precisely the right time, with ample lifespan. He was watching as the day for the Dragon-kin to verify as True Dragons and loosen the shackles of Water-virtue drew near. At that time, the world would be thrown into turmoil, the very moment for dragons and snakes to ride the winds of change!

Any treasures or legacies obtained from the Great Tomb River, or even witnessing a secret or two, or a cultivator verifying the Dao, could all influence whether Guanghou could perfect his divine abilities in the next two or three hundred years, or even ride the momentum to verify the Golden Core!

But this Mansion Water Daoist Master ultimately remained silent, unwilling to speak. After a long time, he finally spoke in a cold voice,

"The foundation for achieving the Dao is secondary. Guanghou has a question he would like to ask the 'esteemed lords'."

Sima Yuanli's smile remained, but the hand pinching the chess piece suddenly froze. The black piece was held between his two fingers, its color dark and gloomy, as the Daoist Master before him had already begun to speak.

"I wonder, when the old Daoist Master was seeking the Dao, within the Abode of Resentment, who was it that questioned his crime?"

_(TL: "The Abode of Resentment" is shorthand for the Exiled Immortal's Resentful Abode, the artifact used to confine Yuansheng.)_

The mountain instantly fell into dead silence, broken only by the sound of falling ice and snow.

When Yuanshang perished while verifying the Dao, his words had not been sealed; rather, they resonated with heaven and earth. Those who heard them at the time were not few, yet no one dared to ask, their hearts secretly shaking in alarm!

If even outsiders reacted this way, how much more so the several Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters of the Pure Unity Dao Gate, who deeply suspected that Yuanshang had not verified into some demonic evil? The thorn in their hearts was naturally difficult to erase. This matter, the Pure Unity Dao Gate knew, and the Yang Clan knew as well!

The Yang Clan, re-establishing the True Qi, intended to gather the old subjects of the former Ning State and naturally had designs on Pure Unity early on. But because of this matter, the Pure Unity Dao Gate had ignored the Yang Clan's hints several times. It even reached the point where the Yang Clan had no choice but to first capture Ridge-crossing Peak, sending several different batches of people, and even the Xi Clan, to interfere, yet none of it had led to any progress.

It had all led to this day, to Sima Yuanli's arrival.

Sima Yuanli's smile remained, as if he had not heard the question. After a long, long time, he slowly set down the black chess piece in his hand and replied,

"Since the Daoist Master does not answer, you must still be deliberating. But time is tight, and I fear we may miss the destined opportunity. Qinghu is at Ridge-crossing Peak. Once the Daoist Master has considered it, you are most welcome to come find me there."

He stood up, saluted the two of them, and transformed into a gust of spring wind, scattering like smoke.

From beginning to end, Guanghou maintained his posture, his expression gloomy, though he seemed unsurprised. Beside him, Che Hong's eyes were slightly closed, his jaw tight, as he, too, remained silent.

Only then were faint footsteps heard within the wind and snow.

A white-robed sword cultivator approached from the distance, standing amidst the white snow, his robes flapping loudly in the wind. He stopped within the Jade Terrace Mountains, gazing in the direction Sima Yuanli had departed.

Guanghou finally rose, gave a deep salute, and said in a low voice,

"Master!"

This person was Fuxuan.

His expression was relatively calm, but the aura around him fluctuated unstably, as if he had recently failed an attempt to elevate a divine ability, shaking his foundation somewhat.

A look of worry finally flowed into Guanghou's gloomy gaze. He wanted to step forward and support him, but the Daoist Master waved his hand to stop him. Fuxuan said.

"It is nothing."

Back when Daoist Master Yuanshang had perished, this sword cultivator had stood in the snow for a long, long time. Whether it was confusion or grief, all such expressions had vanished from his face, leaving only an ice-cold smile.

He said, "Guanghou, you should make the trip."

Guanghou stared at him for a moment and said,

"This junior believes..."

Fuxuan stretched out his hand, cutting off the rest of his words. He said quietly,

"The one who can concede this much is not the Yang Clan, it is Yang Ruiyi. They cannot tolerate too many refusals... As for the Great Tomb River, just treat it as a destined opportunity. I will have Che Hong handle the matters that follow."

Che Hong immediately agreed. But when Guanghou heard this, his expression changed.

"I fear it is inconvenient to let Chang'er get involved."

The sword cultivator before him turned away.

"In all of the Pure Unity Dao Gate, only you cultivate Mansion Water and have formed a divine ability. Only you..."

His gaze was calm as he said coolly,

"Do not practice the Supreme Yin."

...

In the golden palace, multicolored light swirled; the Lesser Yang was in flux.

The flames within the palace were as ethereal as mist. A crimson-robed man sat cross-legged within, his hands forming a lotus mudra, meditating. Crimson mist drifted with his every breath, circulating throughout the great hall.

An unknown amount of time passed before he exhaled a streak of white qi, causing all the flames in the hall to twist and distort. The young man's golden eyes slowly opened, instantly stabilizing all the qi in the great hall.

'The Yin Divination Li Branch is finally refined!'

He regulated his aura, then raised his hand and pinched his fingers in calculation, nodding secretly.

'Three years...'

This Radiant Fire spiritual item, although it could not compare to the Radiant Si Apricot Fruit Li Jiangqian had obtained back then, which had been worthy of a Luoxia noble family's collection, was nonetheless a genuine treasure.

'If an ordinary cultivator wanted to fully utilize this Yin Divination Li Branch, they would definitely have to find an Alchemist to pair it with all sorts of supplementary ingredients, refining it into five or eight pills, taking one every one or two years, only then could they slowly exhaust its properties.'

Li Jiangqian, however, had swallowed it directly. Although he missed the step of refining it into pills with supplementary ingredients, resulting in a much lower total absorption and appearing extravagant, the advantage was in refining it all at once. In two years, he had finished a path that would take others nearly ten years!

With the refinement of this spiritual item complete, the first and most striking manifestation was the progress in his divine abilities. The March of Peace, which he had only just cultivated, immediately stabilized, shining brightly and reaping significant benefits.

'These past three years were enough to match eight years of an ordinary cultivator's hard work!'

The cultivation methods from the High Firmament Pavilion had never been subpar; any single one of them would be considered a top-tier Dao inheritance in the current age. This March of Peace was likewise difficult to cultivate, and he was still some distance from perfection, but even so, Li Jiangqian was quite pleased.

After all, given Li Zhouwei's words, what Li Jiangqian valued most right now was the improvement of his divine abilities. That he could intake the spiritual item into his heart-mansion and consume it with the aid of Talisman Qi, nearly using it to its utmost potential, was already extremely astonishing!

'The benefit to my life-mandate is naturally not as good as the Radiant Si Apricot Fruit, and the power of my Radiant Fire has only risen by a mere five percent or so compared to before... This is something that must be accumulated over time...'

He let out a long, slow breath.

'There is still one more Yin Divination Li Branch, but using a repeated item isn't very effective. It's perfect to leave it for Suihuan's attempt at the Purple Mansion Realm... Then again, there is still the Yin Sun Radiance Leaf.'

According to Li Jiangqian's judgment, this Yin Sun Radiance Leaf was in no way inferior to the Radiant Si Apricot Fruit from before; it was also a top-tier Radiant Fire spiritual item. If he consumed it right now, then spent some time consolidating and polishing his cultivation, his next divine ability would be right before his eyes!

'It's just... a bit too precious.'

This was the kind of treasure other Daoist traditions kept at the bottom of their chests, used to break through to the Purple Mystery. Even though Li Zhouwei had given his approval beforehand, Li Jiangqian felt it wasn't right to consume such items one after another. He still planned to mention it first.

'What's more, if I take this medicine now and enter seclusion, it will inevitably take even longer, possibly five or six years... I'm afraid I'll miss the opportunity... Besides, calculating the time, there should be some leads on the Profound Foundation matter by now.'

He walked on fire, passing through his cave dwelling, and in an instant arrived above the lake island. He spotted the dense forest at a glance and saw the marvelous, fiery-red scenery covering the mountain—an aspect of Virile Fire completely different from back then. He couldn't help but praise it aloud, taking two more steps to descend and land upon the mountain peak.

He saw a Daoist Master in white-gold Daoist robes leaning elegantly against a tree, holding a jade slip. On the other side, beneath a massive alchemy furnace, sat an identical Daoist Master, holding his chin in silence. In front of him, a young Daoist stared at the furnace fire, deep in thought.

Li Jiangqian swept a glance over them with a smile, stepped down, and said softly,

"Grand-uncle!"

Though the sound was soft, the commotion it caused was great. The golden alchemy furnace immediately began to shake violently. Li Ximing's eyes snapped open. At the same time, the white-robed Daoist Master sitting before the furnace exploded with a bang, transforming into a streak of deep green light that fled back, vanishing into the true Li Ximing's sleeve!

Li Ximing then appeared before the furnace, extended two fingers, and stabilized the endlessly shaking vessel.

Li Jiangqian was slightly baffled.

"Grand-uncle, this is..."

When an Alchemist refined pills, they had to remain focused at all times, expending great mental energy; there was indeed a rule about not being disturbed. But at the Purple Mansion Realm, with divine abilities at one's disposal, although one often couldn't move, splitting off a wisp of thought was easy—unless one was refining an extremely profound great pill. What's more, who was Li Ximing? Back on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, with people coming and going, he could command a wisp of flame to watch the furnace for him. How could this situation occur?

Li Ximing stabilized the furnace fire, showing no annoyance at the interruption. Instead, his face was all smiles as he said,

"Just a small experiment."

Li Jiangqian shifted his gaze.

"A Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body?"

"Can't hide it from you!"

Li Ximing shook his head with a laugh.

"The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body has received a great deal of nourishment over the years, and I have been improving daily. I was no longer satisfied with only using it as a substitute during the final step of warming the pills, so I tried letting the alternate body handle the refining process completely..."

He shook his head with a hint of regret.

"If you hadn't come, I was just about to lose control... In the end, I'm still lacking by just a bit."

Li Jiangqian pondered this.

Over the years, Grand-uncle Li Ximing's Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body had performed many miracles and absorbed a great deal of damage for him. Whenever it sustained any injury, it was moved into the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance to be healed with Supreme Yin Moon Radiance and an extremely dense supply of spiritual qi. This was hardly as simple as 'received a great deal of nourishment'...

'From past to present, there have probably been few people so extravagant!'

It was precisely because of this that Li Ximing's Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body progressed at a divine speed. For others, their Dao-Profundity dragged the alternate body's progress along; for him, it was the alternate body dragging his cultivation along.

Thus, Li Jiangqian said,

"Grand-uncle, you needn't worry. The art of fire control has never been a problem for you. Even the alternate body isn't much weaker, which already solves a great deal of trouble."

He paused slightly, then lowered his voice.

"Three years have passed in a flash. Luoxia... how is it?"

Li Ximing let out a laugh.

"Naturally, it's unharmed. In fact, it's more than unharmed..."

"Grand General Yang has been guarding Luoxia all these years, and the north has launched no effective counter-attacks. They migrated all the common people two years ago, which eliminated many hidden dangers. The Compassion Dao finally managed to send someone, but they were detected in advance and ambushed in Ruzhou. River Chief has also been hesitant to venture beyond the pass..."

His expression turned strange as he said,

"I'd say... that group in the north is still on tenterhooks, estimating that your father's injuries must have healed long ago. They live in fear of which corner he's waiting in under the cover of the Exiled Qi, so they retreat at the slightest sign of trouble... One Yang Ruiyi is already terrifying enough. Add a King Wei to that, and if they set an ambush, how many people in the world could possibly escape?"

"How could River Chief not be afraid? I'd wager... even if you made him the Maha Liangli, he still wouldn't dare step foot out of Zanmen Gate!"
