# Chapter 1295: The Sunken Realm

That flowing white light had already transformed into a phantasmal shadow, akin to a star in the heavens, slowly receding into the distance; a million thoughts flickered through Li Jiangqian's mind, yet in an instant, he cast them all aside, his heart stirring with a secret tremor.

‘The Great Void… just as I thought, it’s gone.’

Just like Wanling Heaven back then, Li Jiangqian could not sense the slightest trace of the Great Void in this place. Within his spiritual sense, there was not a single fissure to traverse, and both his Shengyang Acupoint and divine abilities were retracted deep within his dharma body, sealed away completely!

His gaze fell once more to the world below, and what filled his pupils was a vast, unending river surging eastward.

The river was so wide one could not see its banks, its waters were the color of ink, and it surged onward beneath a thick shroud of fog; floating upon its surface was an exceptionally dense spiritual qi and all manner of Pit Water energies, and occasionally, a floating lotus throne or two would drift past, clearly the positions of previous cultivators.

Li Jiangqian had seen the breadth of great rivers before, yet this sight still moved him, and an entirely different thought surfaced in his mind.

‘My spiritual sense isn’t being suppressed!’

Back when Li Zhouwei had gone to Wanling Heaven, that entire world suppressed spiritual sense and constantly drained the dharma power from one's body. This grotto-heaven was completely different, feeling open and free, allowing his spiritual sense to sweep across the vast river surface unimpeded, and were it not for the dense Water Virtue making him quite uncomfortable, it would be a veritable cultivation holy land.

‘Except for this water…’

Li Jiangqian's gaze swept over the river surface at his feet, and just as he suspected, he felt his spiritual sense gradually weaken within it, leading him to an instant judgment,

‘Spiritual resources and palaces must be at the bottom of this great river! The contest for treasures will also undoubtedly be within this river!’

This did not mean, however, that the area above the river was safe—the place was fraught with hidden dangers, and while the riverbed was somewhat better, swimming to the surface would inevitably expose one to everyone's sight, becoming a target for all.

He did not hesitate; seizing the advantage of having entered a step ahead of the others, he immediately sank into the water, finding it so dark he could not see his hand before his face, and at once, his spiritual sense flared as he recited the incantation in his mind,

Spirit Probe!

The vast darkness before him instantly cleared, revealing the immense aquatic expanse in perfect detail. Li Jiangqian drifted deeper and soon discovered a series of palaces on the riverbed.

These palaces were of varying sizes and heights, all suspended within the river water; Li Jiangqian casually entered one hall first, only to find its grand formation had long been destroyed, and after a careful scan and a thorough search, he barely managed to retrieve a single spiritual resource.

This spiritual resource was a pitch-black, shimmering scale, smaller than his palm, and Li Jiangqian immediately found it familiar,

“Cangzhou Serpent Scale?”

Back then, Dingyang Zi of Sun-Worshipping Mountain had used this very item for pill refinement, and Li Ximing had a surplus one every so often. Li Jiangqian had been fortunate enough to see it once, yet he faintly sensed something was off.

“It seems a bit smaller, and the color is deeper…”

He didn't dwell on it, simply stowing it away. With the aid of Spirit Probe, he was like a fish in water, and he first put on a show of breaking into several halls, where his harvest was indeed only items from the Qi Refining level, causing him to frown immediately and mutter,

“The Chen Clan fled in a hurry and left much behind, but this grotto-heaven must have housed many cultivators back then, including plenty from the Qi Refining realm… I must check the deeper areas.”

Thus, he shot toward the riverbed without hesitation, everything around him receding like dim shadows as the surroundings grew increasingly sparse. Only after a long while did he finally see the riverbed's pitch-black profound stone, which was as smooth as a mirror.

By the time he reached this place, the Pit Water qi was already overwhelmingly intense, and even Li Jiangqian, a cultivator of Fire Virtue divine abilities, felt short of breath and stifled as he searched along the riverbed for a time. At last, he spotted a continuous complex of palaces.

This palace complex had glazed tiles and blue-brick walls, its colors vivid as it shimmered faintly in the gloomy water; its formations, however, flickered erratically, seemingly unstable due to damage to its Profound Foundation.

‘I heard that Great Tomb River was originally a grotto-heaven on the verge of collapse, only temporarily stabilized by a True Monarch. Now that it’s been activated and subjected to so many disturbances, its formations have become unstable!’

Li Jiangqian was instantly delighted. He channeled a strand of divine ability in his hand, summoning his heart-fire.

This heart-fire, coalesced from his divine ability, was originally the size of a fist, but now it manifested in his palm as barely three fingers wide, its amber brilliance flickering constantly as if under great suppression.

‘What a pity…’

This place was simply too disadvantageous for Fire Virtue cultivators. The spiritual environment, utterly different from the outside world and overwhelmingly skewed toward Water Virtue, combined with the boundless Pit Water phenomena, suppressed his divine abilities by a full thirty percent and weakened his heart-fire by twenty percent, and it would have been even worse if not for the Supreme Yang aspect of his Great Scripture of Radiance.

Fortunately, Li Jiangqian had the aid of Spirit Probe and detected no figures nearby at all. There was only one palace several hundred li away, which no one else had even noticed!

He therefore unhesitatingly swallowed the heart-fire and formed a hand seal, sending motes of red light leaping out to circle his palm—it was precisely the Red Radiance of Great Radiance.

These motes of red light leaped about, and impressively, there were already eight of them!

Li Jiangqian had found no time to cultivate these spell arts in recent years. Merely by ingesting two spiritual items, combined with mastering the Great Scripture of Radiance and achieving the March of Peace, this spell art had naturally advanced to eight motes!

But his movements did not pause in the slightest as he simultaneously drew upon his Talisman Qi.

Greedy Snare of Profound Li!

This Talisman Qi responded, his life-mandate pulsed for a second time, and another eight motes of Red Radiance leaped out, converging and impressively condensing into Golden Radiance—unbeknownst to anyone, Li Jiangqian's progress in the Great Radiance of White Brilliance had already caught up to Li Ximing, reaching a full sixteen motes. He was only four motes short of two Golden Radiances, meaning he only needed to condense two more himself!

His expression remained placid, but the red robe on his body lit up simultaneously as the Imperial Radiance ability of his Celestial Yang Profound Fire Robe flared, unleashing an intensely dense golden light; although it weakened rapidly under the world's suppression and the water's erosion, it arrived in an instant, smashing viciously into the grand formation.

“Boom!”

Invisible fluctuations rippled outward. The grand formation, already in a state of decay, finally collapsed under the assault of the Radiant Fire spell art.

The Great Radiance of White Brilliance was a major Dharma Art, after all, and striking with full power consumed an enormous amount of energy. Li Jiangqian panted lightly, but the moment the formation shattered, the March of Peace within him suddenly responded, and a golden light descended to drape over his body.

He used this to enter the palace, flying deep within without hesitation; activating the March of Peace once more, a sheet of golden light swept out, clearly revealing the contents of a side hall below.

Two beams of golden light immediately shot down, smashing the doors of the side hall, and two black-and-white intertwined objects were instantly drawn out, landing in the jade case in his hand!

Meanwhile, he had already drawn his golden spear and descended upon another hall himself. With a horizontal sweep, he smashed the unprotected building to pieces and retrieved a bronze lamp with the spear's tip.

Unlike the place where Li Zhouwei had landed back then, which was swarming with cultivators, he had entered a moment early thanks to the Underworld, and by diving straight in, he had indeed met no resistance.

But he did not relax in the slightest—his Spirit Probe detected someone in the distance already rushing straight for this location, having clearly sensed the disturbance.

Thus, he flared with fire and ascended, heading straight for the main hall!

The entire main hall was built from enormous blocks of lapis lazuli and black glazed stone, but its flying eaves had collapsed, shattered tiles were scattered about, its reliefs were worn, and the jade-like palace doors already hung wide open. Inside, an exquisitely carved stone table lay overturned, a single round pearl had rolled onto the floor, and all was utterly silent.

Li Jiangqian's figure appeared before the hall, but he froze in his tracks.

The great hall's interior was exceedingly deep, its profound pillars crystalline and looking ready to collapse from the great tremors, yet in the very center stood a painting.

The scene in the painting was peculiar and constantly shifting, depicting a world of dim skies, fierce storms, and boundless lightning—a strange spectacle of a world tearing itself apart.

This apocalyptic scene centered on a tall young man draped in robes of Profound Yellow, a jade seal hanging at his side. He stood astride a ferocious beast, one hand raising a jade imperial seal high, the other tightly clutching a handful of dense scales.

The scales, sharp as blades, cut deep into his palm, drawing amber-colored blood, yet the young man seemed utterly oblivious, his face a complete blank!

Behind the young man, a massive, long-feathered, four-footed, and winged beast lay prostrate on the ground, blood streaming from it like a waterfall.

Beyond all this, further to the north, rose a monstrous, sky-high wave in the shape of a dragon-serpent. Within the surging currents, the glint of a ferocious scale or claw could be seen, as if a pair of somber eyes lurked within the deluge, surveying the mortal world.

Even the water flowing through the hall seemed to stagnate, permeated by a bone-deep sense of desolation; under the gaze of those eyes, an intangible yet heavy pressure lingered, refusing to disperse.

Li Jiangqian's eyes narrowed slightly, and he saw four golden characters floating beneath the profound painting.

‘The Chasm Cataclysm.’

The Daoist Master stared intently, as if possessed, and only after a long moment did he slowly take a step back.

Li Jiangqian's divine abilities were screaming warnings, and under his Spirit Probe, the dangerous aura from the painting felt as if it could burst forth at any moment and tear him to shreds.

His gaze shifted slightly, sweeping over the pearl that had rolled onto the floor. Regardless of the enticing aura it emitted, he did not hesitate, taking another step back as his figure dispersed with a soft sound!

The main hall fell silent for an instant, the overturned jade table lying quietly on the floor, when suddenly, a faint cracking sound was heard.

“Kacha.”

The wind and rain in the painting began to stir, and as lightning interlaced, it struck a small crack in the painting's surface; immediately, a trickle of wind and rain emerged, pattering onto the glazed floor.

“Kacha!”

Another bolt of lightning struck.

The wind and rain within the hall grew fiercer, and the river water in the painting suddenly began to flow, as if it would surge out of the profound painting and sweep across the eight wastes. The young man astride the beast seemed to be slowly fading, his grip loosening bit by bit.

A faint tremor ran through the great hall.

The winged beast prostrate on the ground shifted its body slightly, as if gasping in pain. The fierce beast held in the young man's grip, however, turned its eyes to stare fixedly at the hall's exit, while the glimpse of scale and claw within the distant, dragon-serpent waterfall had already vanished.

A pair of white boots stepped onto the floor.

The light of the dust-covered white pearl on the floor shimmered as it was picked up by a fair, clean hand. Its glazed surface cast myriad reflections, illuminating a handsome young face with fine eyebrows and large eyes, as well as a meticulously kept beard.

He tossed the jade pearl a few times before tucking it into his sleeve, then meticulously straightened his robes, righted the overturned stone table, sat down primly, and quietly watched the figure that was rushing from the sky toward the front of the hall.

This newcomer held a long halberd, cutting a heroic figure with his high crown, broad sash, and shining feathered robes as he rode upon the Profound Yellow Qi; he seemed to be getting his bearings, and only after confirming this was the place did he steady himself, immediately spotting the person inside the hall.

His pupils dilated rapidly, his blood running cold as if he had fallen into an icy cavern. A dignified Daoist Master, he was struck speechless for an instant as he heard the man in the hall say with a laugh,

“Fellow Daoist Touba, you’ve been tricked again!”

“Rumble!”

A terrifying storm of divine abilities exploded forth in an instant. A two-toned radiance of Profound Yellow shot toward the heavens, blasting all the water aside, and an extremely solid, dark light tinged with dense blood-red fled from within, only then did an extremely earnest voice echo throughout the sea,

“Please, flee for your life!”

...

‘Great Tomb River.’

The world was dim, the waters churned, and in the vast expanse, there was only the ceaselessly flowing river, all else was boundless gloom. A man in white robes stood in the dark sky, quietly looking down.

Lu Jiangxian had already entered this remnant grotto-heaven and was strolling within it, his gaze sharp.

‘How very strange.’

This grotto-heaven was utterly different from the others he had seen. Its overall shape was a ring, sunken down with a raised center, like a circular trench dug into flat ground, with its head connected to its tail.

‘This is the Sunken Pit of the Pit Water.’

And the long river within it surged ceaselessly, head connected to tail, flowing endlessly in this circular pit, completely isolated from the outside world. Had it not been opened by outsiders, this world could have cycled on infinitely.

His gaze, however, pierced through the endless current, instantly seeing the single point of brilliance that existed at the bottomless riverbed, sealed by all manner of supreme divine abilities.

This brilliance was exceptionally captivating, a single, concentrated point of infinite aspects. It was as if the waters of a hundred rivers converged to flow within the earth, pressed by heavy gorges, moving through their midst as overlapping shadows, thereby achieving clarity before surging into the sea!

‘The Pit Water Metallic Essence!’

The completely different aura transmitted from it indicated one thing.

‘This is that Pit Water Metallic Essence from the past, the Peril-Practicing Pit Water of the Sunken Way that Xiao Chuting spoke of! It wasn't just the profound divine abilities of the mighty expert who hid this grotto-heaven; it was this Metallic Essence—the existence of this item is the fundamental reason Great Tomb River was able to independently maintain its world and self-circulate for so long!’

‘But things are different now.’

Lu Jiangxian could clearly sense that as this grotto-heaven gradually reconnected with the outside world and broke free from the Metallic Essence's control, everything within this realm would, without a True Monarch's intervention, slowly draw closer to the present-day Pit Water Fruition Attainment.

‘The Pit Water overflows.’

The external manifestation of this change was the surging river beneath his feet!

‘As this grotto-heaven is slowly tamed by the Fruition Attainment, the water level is rising at a slow but steady pace, attempting to overflow from this Sunken Pit of the Pit Water…’

The moment the waters fill this world will be the moment Great Tomb River disintegrates, and it will also be the moment the Metallic Essence leaps forth from the sunken pit—furthermore, it is the very opportunity for Dao attainment that Xiao Chuting has prepared for all these years!

According to Lu Jiangxian's calculations, even with no interference, this would happen in no more than three months. If any other major upheavals occurred, it would inevitably be sooner.

‘Moreover…’

He slowly raised his head, his solemn gaze sweeping the horizon, looking at the figures outside the grotto-heaven—figures so vast they connected heaven and earth, forced to bow and stoop to fit within the world.

‘They’ve all come.’
