# Chapter 1328: Approaching the Nest

The Great Void trembled.

A blazing Heavenly Light, bright as the sun, illuminated the darkness, revealing a lone figure standing beneath the Merging Fire. His face was gaunt, his hair and beard sparse save for a small mustache, and though he was wreathed in a gloomy light, he was in an extremely wretched state.

His face was covered in blood, the spirit robe on his upper body was in tatters, and his thin arms were bare, covered in centipede-like markings. Seemingly unable to withstand the fire any longer, he spat blood and pleaded mournfully,

"King Wei! Lord Qiao! Withdraw your divine ability..."

"This Wu... this Wu submits!"

He cried out to the heavens, utterly humbled and without a trace of the dignity befitting one with divine abilities. The Heavenly Light finally began to dim, and as the divine ability receded, a laugh could be heard.

"Fellow Daoist Wu... this great gift from me... are you enjoying it?"

A bright splendor rose from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's body as he clutched a wound at his waist, his mouth filled with a bitter taste as he spoke,

"Daoist Master Qiao, do not mock me... This Wu submits..."

Li Zhouwei had turned northward, seizing the opportunity to intercept this Daoist Master who had come as a reinforcement. He had thought it a foolproof plan, but to his surprise, this Daoist Master Wu had some skill, sensing the danger in advance and nearly escaping.

The man fled with incredible speed, and it took Li Zhouwei the time of an incense stick to catch him, nearly letting him escape into Xuan Chao City. A sweep of the Imperial Observation of the Origin revealed the truth—this so-called Daoist Master Wu was actually a Veiled Yin cultivator!

The consequences of this were easy to imagine.

Li Zhouwei had fought a Veiled Yin cultivator in the past, back when his Bright Yang divine abilities were still maturing, and even then he had not been afraid. Now, as a Great Daoist Master suppressing a lesser cultivator, the sheer force of his power was something Daoist Master Wu was the first to experience, and his heart was now filled with bitterness.

A single strike from the Pure Yang Bracelets left Wu Miao dizzy and disoriented, the plea for mercy caught in his throat. A second strike from the Heavenly Audience Gate broke his back, rendering him unable to even cry out in pain. Before the third fist could fall, he finally found a moment to breathe and screamed for his life.

Li Zhouwei had used his full strength—after all, the man before him could unleash divine abilities with terrifying speed, suggesting he was not weak. But unexpectedly, Wu Miao's skills were not as impressive as he thought. Li Zhouwei nodded and said calmly,

"Since you submit, state your name."

The thin, Daoist-robed Master broke out in a cold sweat. Having survived the ordeal, he felt no hesitation now. He bowed with extreme deference, his thoughts racing as he spoke,

"Greetings, King Wei. Your subordinate is Wu Miao... from Dangyin... a rogue cultivator... from the Central Plains..."

Li Zhouwei was somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected this man to be from Dangyin, a place he had previously conquered. He raised an eyebrow and said,

"A rogue cultivator? You dare to come south as a rogue cultivator?"

Wu Miao grew even more terrified—he was well aware of the chaos caused Bright Yang, and that everyone in Gu Prefecture had powerful backing. As a mere rogue cultivator, he could be used by this King Wei to make an example of. He quickly said,

"King Wei! Although I am a rogue cultivator, I have been fortunate enough to receive the patronage of the Han Family and handle affairs in Chun City. The Daoist Master of Xuan Chao is in seclusion in Chun City for a breakthrough, so he asked me to watch over this place for him. I received orders earlier to go and serve under the old Daoist Master Wen..."

Qiao Wenliu let out a great laugh, turned around, and said,

"Reporting to King Wei, this person is indeed a cultivator from Dangyin. His ancestors served as Guest Retainers for the Three Yin Han Family, which is how he gained a measure of prestige and access to Chun City... He seeks a favor from the one named Wen, which is why he so eagerly came south to ingratiate himself..."

He sneered.

"But this man is a true scoundrel. In the past, he would latch onto anyone with power. Being from Dangyin and somewhat acquainted with my Qiao family, he would follow the other prominent families and use me as a topic for gossip... He would say that I took another concubine, or that I was greedy for wealth—all just stirring up trouble with his words."

'Aren't those all things you've actually done...'

Qiao Wenliu watched with satisfaction. Wu Miao could only pretend not to hear the sarcasm in his words, cursing inwardly.

'If I had known, I wouldn't have run... A Bright Yang Great Daoist Master and a Lesser Yin with three divine abilities came to catch me, what was the point in running? I just took a beating for nothing...'

But seeing Qiao Sanyi's demeanor, he likely held considerable status with this King Wei. Terrified by his words, Wu Miao dropped to his knees with a thud and said,

"Daoist Master Qiao is right. This humble one, Wu Miao, deserves to be called a scoundrel. Their hearts are dark, and they use my worthless mouth to bring it to light. It gives everyone a laugh, and I get a chance to enter Chun City and build some connections... This can hardly be called envying the talented... On the contrary, with a small figure like me providing them with amusement from time to time, they ended up looking down on fellow Daoist Qiao, which is why you can now act so freely on the outside..."

"It was wrong, a thousand times wrong, all because of my contemptible mouth... I beg fellow Daoist Qiao to see that I have some use and not to hold this grudge against me..."

Qiao Wenliu finally felt vindicated and just laughed heartily, saying,

"I am not a petty man. Now that you've fallen into King Wei's hands, even a scoundrel like you will have to tell me some gossip about the lowlifes in Chun City. In the past, they were the ones who had all the fun. Now it's my turn, so why would I hold a grudge against you!"

Though Qiao Sanyi was not of the best character, he was straightforward, which left Wu Miao stunned. A man usually so quick-witted was momentarily at a loss for words. After a moment's pause, Qiao Sanyi had already turned and said,

"King Wei! This man can be of use."

In a rare moment of seriousness, he said,

"Wen Daoping is of noble status and high renown. His refusal to submit to Bright Yang, followed by his swift suppression, will surely cause unease among the great families. Now, this man surnamed Wu has an insignificant status and a wretched reputation, yet he has already submitted to your authority. He should be put to use to demonstrate that King Wei is above trivial matters and has a heart willing to accept all talented individuals!"

The more Wu Miao listened, the more unpleasant the words sounded. The smile on his face stiffened slightly as he fumed internally.

'Insignificant status, wretched reputation, already submitted to your authority, should be put to use... Qiao Sanyi, why don't you take a look at yourself in the mirror?'

'You submitted even earlier than I did!'

But ultimately, he was pleading on his behalf. Wu Miao was not as tactless as the old men from the south. He bowed deeply, kneeling on the ground. Just as he was about to speak, a cultivator in a silver fur robe beside King Wei said,

"This man has weak foundations. I fear he will flee in the face of battle, which would bring us harm!"

Wu Miao was horrified. He wiped his sleeve and presented the jade talisman for the formation below with both hands, crying out,

"I have no background and no one to protect me! I wish to enter a grotto-heaven but cannot; I wish to roam the four seas but cannot leave! Having pledged my allegiance today, how could I dare to rebel? I will serve King Wei to the death to fulfill my lifelong dream of comprehending the Purple Mystery!"

Liu Changdie's words were merely a caution. Li Zhouwei smiled, feeling quite satisfied—he never expected this man to be much of a fighter anyway.

'This man travels with great speed, so bringing him along won't cause any delay. More importantly, he has a nimble tongue, is well-connected, and knows how to humble himself...'

This was extremely important. The only cultivator from Gu Prefecture by Li Zhouwei's side was Qiao Wenliu, and likely eight out of ten people in Chun City despised him. Fighting against him would force people into a corner where they couldn't surrender without losing face, making him unsuitable as a diplomat.

'Even if I were to subdue the other cultivators of Gu Prefecture, each one is prouder than the last. They would find it difficult enough to bow their own heads, let alone lower themselves to persuade others to surrender.'

The incident with Wen Daoping was certainly due to the old man's own pride, but it was also because the terms offered were not sufficient. Though Li Zhouwei was ruthless in his actions, he saw the situation clearly.

He raised an eyebrow and said, "My apologies for troubling Daoist Master Yuanbian."

Liu Changdie understood, of course. He took the jade talisman and hurried down into the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual formation of Xuan Chao City. King Wei waited a moment, then shook his head and smiled.

"What lies to the west?"

Wu Miao immediately rose to his feet, cupped his hands without a change in expression, and replied without hesitation:

"Xuan Chao is in the northeastern corner of Gu Prefecture. Your lordship came from Mount Jiao in the south. From here, if you were to head east and conquer three cities, you would reach the northernmost part of Gu Prefecture, bordering the Yan Kingdom, the domain of the Qi family... Fu City!"

As he spoke, he secretly glanced at the King. It was common knowledge that Li Zhouwei and Qi Lanyan were bitter enemies; even a rogue cultivator like himself knew this well.

The King noticed his gaze and a faint smile touched his lips.

"Then we go west."

...

Mount Jiao.

The Merging Fire in the sky had dissipated, leaving only a haze of gray. The spiritual formation had lost its light, the earth trembled, and the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was gone. The various spiritual platforms and immortal pavilions on the sacred mountain had all collapsed, and the cultivators below were in a state of chaos.

It wasn't until the sky began to brighten with the first light of dawn and the faint glow of the Buddhist Land slowly faded that a brilliant light arrived from the south amidst the clamor, coming to a stop in the mountains and transforming into a person.

This man had a fair face and a long beard, his expression solemn. A palpable divine ability radiated from him, as if he stood within a hazy crimson flame. A jewel-like red dot adorned his brow, giving him the majestic appearance of a divine general.

His gaze was sharp.

"Quite the Mount Dayang... coming under the banner of reinforcements, yet they wanted to meddle with Mount Jiao. If I hadn't come myself, I'm afraid there would have been a fight here!"

Following closely behind him was a tall, imposing figure. It was Jiang Fuwang.

The expression of this Daoist Master from the Jiang family changed slightly. He scanned the chaotic mountain forest, and seeing that the buildings in the prefecture city were intact, he sighed in relief.

"How did the trouble spread to the east!"

The man beside him spoke with a dark gaze.

"The Joyful Bliss Dao... It's not surprising. Their Daoist tradition is peculiar. Their Dharma Aspect from back then came from the same origins as the Emptiness Dao, only more shameless. Mount Dayang has had its eyes on them for a long time and will soon hold them accountable."

This Great Daoist Master's eyes were icy and filled with anger. His thoughts seemed not to be on why King Wei had taken a detour, but rather on the destruction.

"So ruthless... Mount Jiao was built over centuries, and he burned it to this state with a single fire... This is the lifeblood of generations. Truly the temperament of the Bright Yang, with no regard for spiritual energy..."

Li Zhouwei had used the Merging Fire to swiftly break the spirit mountain without a shred of mercy. The formation platforms were all shattered, to say nothing of the spiritual fields and pavilions; they were all smashed to pieces in one go. The Great Daoist Master watched with a pained heart, but Jiang Fuwang seemed unconcerned.

"In matters of war, how can there be mercy? Senior Longkang, you worry too much... In my view, the priority now should be to find any trace of the old Daoist Master Wen."

"I don't feel sorry for the Wen family, I feel sorry for Gu Prefecture!"

The Great Daoist Master shook his head, disagreeing with him, but said no more. A flicker of emotion crossed his eyes.

"I have already received news from Chun City. The one surnamed Wen is not in mortal danger. He simply miscalculated and was likely captured by some Spiritual Treasure."

They descended, carried by a divine ability. Jiang Fuwang's spiritual sense swept below, and he pulled up a familiar-looking member of the Wen family, a middle-aged man in a long robe. Upon seeing the two of them, the man dropped to his knees with a thud and cried,

"My lords... you must seek justice... for my Wen family!"

Strangely, both figures in the sky seemed uninterested. Jiang Fuwang glanced at him.

"What justice?"

The middle-aged man wept.

"Our old Daoist Master was following esteemed orders to defend the city. When that man arrived from afar and broke through our defenses, he ceased all resistance and surrendered... But who would have thought... in just a few breaths, that lord, without any reason, suddenly attacked and nearly killed our old Daoist Master! The sky was filled with a green wind... This humble cultivator could not see the details and does not know the extent of his injuries..."

Daoist Master Longkang's brow furrowed, but Jiang Fuwang shook his head.

"I have met King Wei. He is not an unreasonable man. That old Daoist Master of yours has always been proud and arrogant. Who knows what was said?"

The middle-aged man only wept. Daoist Master Longkang remained silent, his hands now clasped behind his back. Jiang Fuwang said sharply,

"Go and clean up! Stop shaming yourself here!"

He then dropped the man from his divine ability's hold. Only then did Daoist Master Longkang speak, his voice cold.

"Wen Daoping truly runs a fine household. A mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, what does he amount to, that he dares to accuse a Great Daoist Master of the Bright Yang of wrongdoing! Wen Xuanzhao has been gone for many years, yet the Wen family has only grown more arrogant..."

"As we are of the same Profoundity, it is my duty to discipline them. If our Dao-paths were connected, I would have taught him a harsh lesson on his behalf!"

Jiang Fuwang could only offer a bitter smile. This Great Daoist Master was from the Longkang clan, his given name Yao, and he belonged to the Comprehending Profundity, a descendant of the same tradition as the Wen family. His own Jiang clan belonged to the Encompassing Profundity, so he did not reply, instead lowering his voice.

"He... went north?"

Daoist Master Longkang narrowed his eyes.

"Yes."

The two fell silent for a moment. Jiang Fuwang felt a headache coming on.

"I fear it will be very difficult to catch him. Qiao Wenliu hasn't been seen in the east. With King Wei's speed at breaking formations, he must know the details of Mount Jiao. It is highly likely that Qiao Wenliu is with him. The entire layout of the east... he knows it like the back of his hand. He comes and goes like the wind. How many people would it take to surround him?"

He spoke with calm rationality.

"The key is still Juan City in the west! As long as we can break through there, both Li Zhouwei and Qiao Wenliu will surely fall into disarray. Why waste our time contending with him here?"

Longkang Yao replied, "That is the talk of a strategist. But if one of the twelve great families is defeated so easily, and Chun City simply stands by, how can we maintain order? Look at the state of this mountain now. If we hadn't come, what would have become of the twelve families... In recent times, these few families were driven out of Chun City, and they already harbor much resentment and conflict. How could they withstand such a scandal?"

He sighed.

"Otherwise, I wouldn't have abandoned my post in the south to rush here as reinforcements, to at least try and stop him."

Jiang Fuwang had no choice but to say, "To the north is Xuan Chao, which is already lost... Delayed as we were by Mount Dayang, we certainly won't be able to catch him..."

Longkang Yao raised an eyebrow.

"Do not rush. The Bright Yang cultivators are domineering and seek revenge for the smallest slight. Qi Lanyan targeted him at every turn back then; he must still harbor hatred. His sudden move north is surely aimed at the Qi family. Someone from Chun City has already gone to set up an ambush there. We will hold our position in the south in case he makes a sudden retreat."

"Since he is heading to the fringes, if we block him on one side, we can eventually contain him—as long as we restrict his movements, Juan City will not hold out for long."
