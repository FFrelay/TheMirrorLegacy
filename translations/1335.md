# Chapter 1335: Disciples

Mount Dayang.

Golden lotuses bloomed within the mountains, and glazed light surged. Green and pink flower petals wove through the mountain forests. Monks and nuns moved through the temple courtyards, some wearing expressions of sorrow, others looking dazed. Their demeanors varied, and the sound of conversation rose from all directions.

Atop the high seat, a monk could be seen surrounded by numerous Merciful Ones, listening as a person by his side recounted events one by one.

He spoke, "What an arrogant tone..."

He rubbed his belly and stood up, sneering.

"What sort of thing is that Kongshu? A traitor who abandoned the old to serve the new, yet he dares to make such a grand vow. What? Does he think he is the Revered One of the future, the Aspect Lord of ten thousand ages?"

To the side, a golden body as large as a mountain, white as jade all over, raised its head and pressed its palms together, its voice as placid as water.

"Head Monk, those words are incorrect. Although the position of Revered One is unattainable, seeing how the Lord of the dharma realm values him, achieving a Dharma Aspect is highly probable. There is no harm in making his grand vow a bit larger..."

This person was none other than Tian Langzhi, who had returned from the Great Tomb River!

This Maha Liangli of the Sea of Desire appeared neutral. That face, smooth as jade, showed little change in expression, yet his tone held an indescribable ambiguity that made the monk clasp his hands behind his back and reply,

"What a thing! Pay him no mind... rather, that Kongheng..."

"Kongheng?"

Tian Langzhi furrowed his brows, seeming not entirely unfamiliar with the name. He finally spoke, his tone rather dissatisfied.

"That fellow has been wandering outside for many years as well. I truly do not understand; are the various Lords not tempted? To just let such a genius drift about outside?"

The Head Monk laughed, "During the great war in the Jin lands this time, several Dharma Aspect Lords came to watch. Even our supreme leader appeared. Before leaving, he spoke with me a few times and mentioned this Kongheng."

Tian Langzhi's expression changed instantly. He left his seat and bowed from afar, lowering his head.

"So it was the [Six Incinerations Cinnabar Corpse Flawless Dharma Aspect]... My cultivation is lowly; I actually failed to sense him!"

Mount Dayang stood independent of the various Aspects. The reason it could hold the responsibility of command and management was partly due to the strong support of a few Aspects, but more so because quite a few Dharma Aspects stood behind Mount Dayang.

The disciples and grand-disciples of these Dharma Aspects often came to Mount Dayang to preach or hold office. Most occupied the positions of Chief or Expounder of the Profound. In particular, some who frequently manifested in the world... gave those few Chiefs shocking authority and especially noble status.

Those who most frequently handed down orders were the likes of the [Six Incinerations Aspect] and the [Thunder Sound Aspect]. This gave the Lamp Chief before him and that Thunder Chief exalted status, allowing them to often decide many matters within the mountain. Even he, Tian Langzhi, had to respect them somewhat.

Seeing him bring up the Lord now, Tian Langzhi simply lowered his brow and said,

"I wonder what guidance the Lord has?"

The Lamp Chief smiled.

"Those fellow Daoists who came out of Liaohe back then are all prominent now. Yeren and Daolü need not be mentioned, and now there is Kongshu who speaks wild words. Every one of them has the bearing of a Dharma Aspect. Even the most incompetent, Beigu, can guard a region... Only Fuyan met with disaster and failed to achieve anything... yet there are quite a few Lords who want him."

"This can be considered the most prosperous moment for the younger generation of my Dao in the last century. The Lords in the forest are very gratified, but they also thought that it should not end here. The next generation... it would be good if there were some there as well."

Tian Langzhi was stunned and said, "But Liaohe Temple has long been empty, and there are no disciples or grand-disciples..."

His words came to an abrupt halt as a look of realization appeared. Sure enough, he saw the Lamp Chief smile.

"Is there not still a Kongheng? If we can persuade him to go north, accept the Dao legacy, and teach some disciples and grand-disciples, even if they cannot compare to his senior martial brothers, the karmic affinity will be continued, and they certainly won't be too poor!"

"So that is how it is!"

Tian Langzhi praised and clapped his hands. The Lamp Chief smiled,

"Let him temper himself in other Daos. While he stubbornly refuses to accept people into the Pure Land, he ultimately must accept disciples. Does not the Wrath Dao form karma, assigning a disciple to wait upon him hand and foot?"

Tian Langzhi nodded repeatedly, while the Lamp Chief said with regret,

"A pity. Although he cleaned up Liaohe Temple on his trip north, because he has not yet attained the Grand Dao, he has no mind to pass down the teachings. We must wait a few more years... I have yet to accept a disciple myself... calculating the days... perhaps I could obtain a disciple..."

Seeing the Head Monk sighing greatly, Tian Langzhi smiled.

"I actually have a good seedling for the Chief to look at."

Seeing the other party feign surprise and look up, Tian Langzhi simply clapped his hands and ordered the Buddhist cultivators filling the mountain to retreat. A person was then sent up into the mountain, looking dispirited with brow and eyes cast down. His head was bald and shiny; it seemed he had been cultivating Buddhism for some time.

The Lamp Chief looked down at him from above and said indifferently, "Who is this..."

The monk lowered his head and whispered, "This small monk, secular name Fankang... was originally... originally from Jianghuai..."

"Fankang?"

The Lamp Chief raised a brow and sneered, "Never heard of him!"

Fankang had to lower his head further, lamenting.

"This small monk... this small monk once obtained an opportunity! This small monk once cultivated by Lord Qi's side. My name did not spread... and did not stain the Lord's honored ears!"

The Lamp Chief stopped pretending and laughed.

"So it is you! Back then, the mountain sent people to receive you, yet you insisted on joining Qi Lanyan... What, now that Qi Lanyan is finished, you remember my Buddhist Dao again?"

The mountain fell silent for a moment. Tian Langzhi smiled without speaking, his eyes calm. The monk could only kowtow and say,

"In the past, I did not recognize the splendor of the Holy Land and wrongly cast myself into another path... This small monk... this small monk understands now!"

The Chief still had use for him, so he finally retracted his ridicule, rose from the lotus platform, and smiled.

"People like you never value the Buddhist Dao, always holding scorn in your hearts. Yet when you reach a dead end, do you not still come crawling beneath my Buddhist Land? I understand that you pride yourself on the Heavenly Element and are unwilling now, but since you have knelt, you can no longer regret it!"

Fankang knocked his head repeatedly, saying, "This disciple is willing to give his all for the Buddhist Land, seeking only a smooth path!"

Only then did the Lamp Chief smile and nod.

"Good!"

He flicked his sleeve, collecting the monk on the ground, then looked at Tian Langzhi and smiled.

"Many thanks for the generous gift!"

Tian Langzhi only raised his eyebrows and whispered, "If there are disputes in the future, please provide much assistance!"

These words were spoken obscurely, but regarding the arrangements of the Way of Great Desire, everyone had a general idea in their hearts. The Lamp Chief naturally understood and nodded with a smile, only to hear thundering sounds as someone ascended the steps.

This person was draped in lightning, extremely majestic. The steps thundered under his feet, appearing domineering and imperious. He walked all the way to the high point before standing with arms folded, scanning left and right, and speaking indifferently,

"You two... are truly at leisure."

Tian Langzhi did not wish to offend him, so he turned his head and smiled without speaking. The Lamp Chief looked behind him and saw the young monk, who seemed to be that Minghui of Lotus Temple, so he said,

"So you caught him and brought him back. Hard work for the Chief."

The Thunder Chief, Maodigu, raised a brow at him and said indifferently, "I brought the person back... but there are some rights and wrongs that I need Fellow Daoist to explain."

The relationship between the two was not very good to begin with. The Lamp Chief's expression immediately became rather unpleasant. However, he did not lash out at him, but looked coldly at Minghui and said,

"What? Does Lotus Temple still have words to quibble with?"

Minghui had been weeping with lowered brows, but upon hearing this, he immediately raised his head. His eyes were cold with fury, yet his lips remained tightly sealed, not uttering a word.

The martial brothers of the Joyful Bliss Dao had always been thick-skinned, accepting beatings and scoldings with a smile, all following that Jinlian's nature. The Lamp Chief had long been accustomed to this. Seeing this expression so suddenly, he was both startled and angry, only to hear the Thunder Chief say out of the blue,

"Jinlian is dead!"

These four words were like a clap of thunder, stunning the Lamp Chief.

'What kind of joke is this!... Dead!'

Jinlian's reputation in the Buddhist Dao was definitely not small. Mount Dayang had been very troubled by him back then, and several Mahas privately called him the Venerable Rabid Cur. Even if it wasn't a good title, it was enough to show his fame!

His gaze landed on Tian Langzhi like lightning. He realized that although this Maha Liangli of the Way of Great Desire was surprised, he lowered his head and had nothing to say. He clearly had a guilty conscience... The Lamp Chief was instantly horrified, though he kept his face composed, sneering,

"What sort of figure is Jinlian? You dare bring such words before me? Do you think the Dharma Aspects of my path will not manifest?"

These words actually carried significant weight. Minghui felt a slight fear in his heart, but at this moment, he could only brace himself and continue. He immediately knelt on the ground, expressionless, and said coldly,

"Whatever the Chief says is the truth. Minghui did not go to the north and could not see Master's final end. But Minghui has seen the situation within our Buddhist Land with his own eyes and dares to swear to my path's Dharma Aspect—Master's True Spirit did not return to the Buddhist Land."

He cut straight to the chase, proving his innocence with an icy tone. Since every word was true, streaks of tassel-like light immediately fell from the sky, clearly resonating with the Buddhist Land. Combined with his face, which looked as sorrowful as dead ashes, the mountain fell silent, and even Tian Langzhi looked up in shock.

'Really dead? Really... was he forced to death by our combined hands just like that?'

Minghui was also a Maha. His True Spirit was reflected in the Joyful Bliss Buddhist Land, so naturally, he could not let other paths search his soul. But swearing to the Buddhist Land was completely different!

There was much internal strife within the Buddhist Dao, but no matter how they fought, destroying the Dharma Body was already the greatest punishment. Usually, they would allow the other party's True Spirit to return to the Buddhist Land. If mediation really failed, there was still Mount Dayang—even Mount Dayang would at most inflict various tortures for many years; the annihilation of a True Spirit was extremely rare...

Of course, these Buddhist cultivators had done plenty of borrowing the hands of enemies to remove obstacles. But no matter how much they struggled, beating someone to death in front of everyone was an ugly affair, especially since the other party was not some minor Merciful One, but a Maha, and even a pillar of the Dao!

In an instant, he felt cold sweat break out. Seeing the gazes of the two Chiefs shoot toward him simultaneously, he hurriedly shook his head and said,

"It is true that Fellow Daoist Beimei and I exchanged blows with him, and several Fellow Daoists from the dharma realm also exerted effort. He was overly greedy himself and fell into the encirclement. He also tried to protect his disciples one by one, which is how he lost his Dharma Body... But this True Spirit..."

His words came to an abrupt halt as he lowered his brow and eyes.

'Correct, we did encircle him with full force, wanting to inflict deeper injuries upon him. But by logic, the Dharma Aspect of the Discipline Dao had already arrived and would have protected him somewhat... Who would have thought he would die there in one breath... Could it be that he was blocked by Dharma Aspects of other paths, and the blame has fallen on our heads?'

The more he thought, the more his body was drenched in cold sweat. The Lamp Chief knew quite a bit about the events at Great Tomb River and his train of thought was largely similar. He also put on a contemplative expression. However, the Thunder Chief understood and his tone turned abruptly cold.

"Since that is the case, what else do you two have to say."

Tian Langzhi and the Lamp Chief exchanged a glance. For a moment, they truly could not find any leads and looked at each other in silence. They then saw the young monk fall to his knees with a thud, kowtowing and weeping.

"Liangli, Chiefs... Lotus Temple submits! Lotus Temple submits! My Dao's Dharma Aspect has not manifested for many years. Liangli was in closed cultivation, only wishing to show humility to others. I never thought Chief Jiang would transfer my martial brothers to Jianghuai to be tormented in various ways... Yes... my Lotus Temple was slack, we did avoid the spearhead... But please, Lord, have understanding. With my tiny cultivation, placing myself under the Bright Yang, bowing my head amidst the Exiled Qi, if there was even a bit of offense, my body and spirit would be extinguished. How could I survive?!"

"But my martial brothers considered the greater situation and yielded with all their might time and again. Several senior brothers returned to the Buddhist Land one after another. Even I lost my Dharma Body, and years of cultivation came to nothing. Yet we still thought we could trade this for a night of peaceful sleep. And now... you have killed my Master without cause!"

'Such a sharp tongue! If I had known, I would have killed him by the riverside back then!'

Tian Langzhi cursed in his heart, but the Thunder Chief remained standing with his hands behind his back, his face gloomy. The Lamp Chief dared not look up either, listening in silence. How could he defend himself? He could only pretend not to hear.

The monk, however, knocked his head on the ground with heavy thuds.

"Now... my Martial Uncle and several senior brothers have had their Dharma Bodies destroyed one by one. Master loved his eldest disciple the most, my Lotus Temple's First Senior Brother, yet only his head returned from the north. The extinction of our Daoist tradition is right before our eyes. Forgive me for not daring to obey blindly anymore..."

"From today onwards, my Lotus Temple will seal its gates and never communicate with the outside again!"

"This!"

At these words, the Thunder Chief frowned immediately, while the Lamp Chief stood up instantly, shouting in anger.

"Are you holding a grudge against Mount Dayang!"

Minghui also stood up and said with hatred, "So what if I am!"

In an instant, the color of the world changed, and heavenly thunder rolled. The Thunder Chief turned around and looked at him gloomily. Under such pressure, the young monk's expression did not change in the slightest. He raised his head and said hatefully,

"And Tian Langzhi—listen well. For the sake of the great righteousness of the same path, my Joyful Bliss Dao will not form a blood feud with your Way of Great Desire. But before my martial brothers perish, no cultivator of your Way of Great Desire is permitted to step half a foot into my Joyful Bliss territory... If there is any offense, even if my entire temple cannot harm a hair on your head, we will still resist with all our strength!"

Silence filled the mountain.

'So ruthless...'

One had to know that having lost Jinlian, the Joyful Bliss Dao had already lost its pillar. Now that the senior and junior brothers had all returned as True Spirits, it was practically an empty shell. With King Wei and the Great Song eyeing them covetously, anyone with eyes could see that Lotus Temple's land could definitely not be kept. Their believers would slowly be carved up until little remained. Who knew how many years it would take to recover... yet this Minghui still dared to say such words!

'It really is because Jinlian died that he hates him to the bone... Otherwise, this should be the time to beg for mercy. Why harm others with no benefit to oneself...'

So much so that the Lamp Chief was struck dumb up on the high seat. It even garnered a measure of respect from the Thunder Chief, who actually did not move to stop him, merely watching quietly.

Minghui's face was covered in tears. He extended both hands and said coldly,

"I have said what needed to be said. Two Chiefs, whether it is climbing a mountain of knives, entering a sea of fire, being thrown into a wok of oil, or soaked in a pool of salt, if I, Minghui, utter one extra sound, I am not fit to be a cultivator of the Joyful Bliss Great Dao, nor a disciple of Great Virtue Jinlian!"

There was absolute silence. After several breaths, the Lamp Chief forced a smile and said,

"Impressive... For a Master as greedy for life as Jinlian, he actually has a disciple with such hard bones as you... However, there is no logic in rashly sealing the Dao lineage..."

But the Maha who controlled thunder interrupted him, speaking indifferently, "Men... escort Maha Minghui back first."

The atmosphere in the entire mountain forest stagnated. Minghui stood with his hands behind his back. All gazes were cast upon the Lamp Chief on the high seat. The Maha flicked his sleeves with an ugly expression and narrowed his eyes.

"Good... Since Thunder Chief has spoken, I will certainly report this matter to the Lord and discuss it in detail... When the time comes... it will not be too late to invite the Maha back."
