# Chapter 1294: The Heavenly Vessel

Profound-black light converged within the great hall, illuminating its beams. The main seat hung empty. Below the platform, a woman sat, her hands forming a seal. Streams of golden, talisman-like papers continuously swept past her, dancing within the violent, mercury-hued light like a school of small golden fish.

Li Quewan sat in their midst, methodically directing the streaks of golden light to pass through the crevices of the great hall and join the divine ability operating outside.

Yet, amidst this orderly transformation, a crisp sound echoed.

_Crack..._

The woman's expression changed slightly as she flipped her hand, revealing a talisman from her sleeve.

Li Jiangqian had planned to go and return immediately, yet just as he headed north, a message came back at once. Li Quewan instantly reached a conclusion.

'Something has happened in the north...'

She frowned inwardly.

'It was scheduled for four years from now, how could it be this early!'

Yet she showed not a trace of worry. Her divine ability responded, interrupting the golden talismans shifting in the sky. The mercury light shattered, and the cinnabar-hued divine ability abruptly retracted, pulling the azure cauldron from outside the hall into her grasp!

She clapped her hands together, suppressing the azure cauldron. A moment later, Daoist Master Cheng Qian swiftly entered the hall, his expression pale and his demeanor one of profound apprehension as he bowed with cupped hands and said,

"This is...!"

For three years, Cheng Qian had been diligent, believing himself relatively competent. Now, faced with this sudden event, his first reaction was that he had failed!

The Daoist Master was instantly drenched in a cold sweat. The sheer volume of resources and precious spiritual items the Li family had invested in the Profound Foundation... even if he, Cheng Qian, were sold ten times over, it might not be enough to compensate for it. The thought was utterly terrifying!

Fortunately, Li Quewan merely shook her head gravely.

"Something has happened in the north!"

Cheng Qian actually breathed a sigh of relief, filled with the gratitude of having survived a calamity. He quickly bowed and said,

"In that case... what arrangements should be made?"

Li Quewan intended to visit the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, so she naturally had to entrust her duties first. She solemnly pushed the azure cauldron into his hands, retrieved two jade caskets, and said,

"Add if lead is low, reduce if mercury is high. Yin and Yang must be balanced; this is a matter of the Whole Pill. I need not say more. The Supreme Yin and Radiant Fire items within... Yin can substitute for water, and fire can likewise stand for yang, allowing them to balance. If Radiant Fire proves inconvenient, use Bright Yang. Prioritize stability above all. Do not be sparing with resources. I entrust this to you, Daoist Master!"

She had even arranged a contingency for if Cheng Qian's Dao-Profundity proved insufficient, and then gave another deep bow, startling Cheng Qian so much he quickly stepped aside, waving his hands and saying,

"There is no need to continue refining, merely to maintain. I, Cheng Qian, am a Whole Pill divine ability cultivator, after all. Although I lack the Young Miss's skill, I still understand the transformations. As long as there is no interference, I guarantee there will be no mistakes!"

Li Quewan's expression was grave as she said,

"Grand-Uncle... and our colleagues are all in the west. I will not be at the lake. Regardless of resource allocation, everything is at your command. If you are beset on two fronts, you may, if necessary, have them abandon the west and retreat to the lake to make their stand!"

Cheng Qian nodded grimly and was just reaching out to accept when he suddenly froze.

His face lifted, and he abruptly saw someone on the main seat behind Li Quewan.

This person was clad in ink-black robes, his dark hair unbound. Behind him, Heavenly Light scattered and transformed into a multicolored radiance shaped like a screen. His features were resolute, and he exuded an inviolable, chilling majesty. His eyes were pure gold, as if flickering with leaping white flames.

Cheng Qian knew who he was.

'King... King Wei...'

His mere presence filled the great hall with an eerie brightness, a light that threatened to overwhelm the eyes and tear them to shreds, thick with a savage, baleful aura.

That golden gaze swept across his face like a beam of light in a dark room, illuminating the Whole Pill Daoist Master's features.

Li Zhouwei.

But what made Cheng Qian's mind go blank was not King Wei's sudden appearance, but the overwhelming Heavenly Light radiating from Li Zhouwei, and the Bright Yang qi so potent it threatened to tear the hall asunder.

All of this pointed to one other fact.

'Great Daoist Master!!'

The Daoist Master was stunned, then overwhelmed by profound shock. Li Quewan sensed it too. She spun around and froze in place, which in turn snapped Cheng Qian out of his daze. He took a step back and dropped to the ground in a lightning-fast kowtow.

"Greetings, Your Majesty!"

Even though Li Quewan had long held suspicions, she could not help but be utterly stunned. She blinked, her eyes suddenly dry, then instantly welled with tears as she, too, fell to her knees, exclaiming with joy.

"Uncle!"

'A Great Daoist Master! Uncle has surpassed the Purple Mystery!'

Li Quewan was less affected, but a chill shot straight to Cheng Qian's mind. He instantly understood everything, and finally realized what it meant for King Wei to have surpassed the Purple Mystery.

'The Great Tomb River!'

As their trembling voices echoed, the doors of the great hall slammed shut, sealed by a potent Bright Yang divine ability, and only then did a steady voice speak.

"Has the Great Tomb River opened?"

Li Quewan bowed and reported,

"My brother went north to observe. He has not returned, but he crushed his jade talisman, which means... at the very least, it is about to open!"

'Just as I thought.'

It had taken Li Zhouwei two years to master the Imperial Observation of the Origin and a mere two hundred days to surpass the Purple Mystery. In truth, it had been less than three years total. He had not emerged immediately after his breakthrough, but had spent nearly half a year stabilizing his divine ability, right up until this day!

'More than half a year ago, I crushed the jade talisman to send a message to Daoist Master Xiao...'

Li Zhouwei and Xiao Chuting had exchanged jade talismans, each holding a wisp of the other's divine ability, allowing one to signal the other by crushing it. Li Zhouwei had sent his message to Xiao Chuting, but the Daoist Master had delayed his response until now.

King Wei stood up, a flicker of contemplation in his eyes.

'And only now has his message finally arrived.'

Li Zhouwei understood with a moment's thought.

'He guessed I was about to surpass the Purple Mystery.'

'This old Daoist Master's foresight is truly meticulous. He is instructing me not to leave the lake and enter Luoxia prematurely.'

While Xiao Chuting could indeed open the Great Tomb River, it would certainly require time. The Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman might deceive those at the Purple Mansion Realm, but it could not fool True Monarchs. Only while Li Zhouwei remained at the lake would the other factions remain ignorant of his change in strength. The moment he left, he would be discovered!

Even if the wait was only a day or two, if he, Li Zhouwei, went prematurely, the other powers could react in that short time and make their own moves!

'He means to wait until the grotto-heaven opens, until all factions have entered, their moves are set, and the board is closed. Only then will he notify me to leave the lake and enter the grotto-heaven directly, seizing the advantage by striking last!'

A flash of admiration crossed his features.

'Furthermore, this implies there is likely a buffer of time within the grotto-heaven, be it due to ancient formations or the inheritance lying deep within, which means I should not be too late to assist.'

The amusement in the newly advanced Bright Yang Great Daoist Master's eyes deepened as he stood, his gaze falling upon Li Quewan, his voice brimming with soaring battle intent.

"Let's go!"

...

Huan Prefecture.

The sky was a gloomy expanse, like a sea of ink pressing down upon Mount Daling. Streaks of divine abilities flickered like bobbing lanterns, their light waxing and waning.

'Too fast...'

Li Jiangqian waited in the mountains for a time, his expression growing dark. He looked up, his gaze distant, and glimpsed a man in golden robes standing within the True Fire, his hands clasped behind his back.

Tianhuo wore a faint smile.

Li Jiangqian's smile was warm.

'The moment he finished speaking, Xiao Chuting arrived on the wind. It cannot be a coincidence. The so-called several days' journey was just a fabrication, a whim to deceive me... spoken so gently, with so much leeway!'

'He knew who I was waiting for. Fortunately, I warned the family at once!'

A thousand thoughts spun through Li Jiangqian's mind, yet his smile remained polite and cordial. In the distance, Tianhuo stood with hands clasped behind him, a flicker of contemplation in his gaze.

'Truly not here?'

He stood silently, a whispering voice reaching his ear via a divine ability,

'Undetectable... It's highly likely they didn't come. Logically, the refinement level of the Tantai family's glazed talisman shouldn't be able to avoid a Heaven-Governing probe!'

The voice was somewhat aged, belonging to Daoist Master Chunshuo of the Golden Feather.

'They simply didn't come! Perhaps they truly do want that Bright Yang spiritual root. After all, it's a first-class item in this world; it's impossible for them not to be tempted.'

Tianhuo's lips barely moved.

'Impossible.'

He himself had been the one to persuade Li Quewan, and he had been the one to promise her many benefits, yet now he was this certain!

But their subtle exchange was quickly interrupted. The black-robed monk had already taken to the wind. At last, within the dark, sea-like expanse of clouds, arcs of light began to surface, a dark purple interweaving, like glazed light rising and falling in the cloudy sea.

'The Great Tomb River...'

"Rumble!"

A deafening roar resounded through the world. The figure in the straw rain-cloak strolled between heaven and earth, his Azure Heaven Bronze chariot like a dragon in the mist, revealing but a scale and a claw.

"Xiao Chuting!"

Searing True Fire stained the southern sky a faint red as the golden-robed Daoist Master strode through the air. Water and fire clashed, erupting with an earth-shattering boom.

_Rumble!_

A dense radiance of water crashed down, weaving through the flames as freely as a nimble black Flood Dragon ascending to the heavens. Xiao Chuting had no intention of engaging him.

'Position Follows Peril'!

The old Daoist Master's figure vanished within, followed closely by a series of figures whose divine abilities shook the heavens. In the distance, Tianhuo and Su Yan had already entered.

Li Jiangqian, however, remained perfectly still. Not only him, but Sima Yuanli and Yu Xi beside him also had not moved.

'A traversing technique...'

For a brief moment before a grotto-heaven manifests, it merges with the Great Void. Those with a Great Void-walking technique, or a Cultivation Transcendence-type Spiritual Artifact, can enter prematurely. Tianhuo and his group had done just that, while the others were naturally half a step behind.

'The Great Void-walking technique...'

Li Jiangqian's gaze turned cold.

Among the various Great Void techniques, his family's own Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam strictly counted as one. The three most common arts were creation, traversing, and isolation. The Great Void isolation art, the foundation of many Purple Mansion Realm grand arrays, was not difficult to find. The first two, however, were tightly locked away by the major Daoist Traditions.

The High Firmament Pavilion also possessed a traversing technique, but the Li family's one-thousand-odd immortal merits were barely enough to exchange for it, so they had long resolved to find one in the mortal world. Li Jiangqian could only wait, but unexpectedly, a figure stepped out from the Great Void. The ancient cauldron in his hand tilted, and a spiritual light flashed, revealing a strange, vase-like object in the sky.

The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel!

A pure white path unfurled, like a walkway from the heavens!

"Cultivators of the Great Song, enter with me!"

Yang Ruiyi was half a beat slow, but his deep, resonant voice echoed through the sky, bringing a flash of joy to Li Jiangqian's eyes:

'This Song Emperor is reliable after all!'

Joy appeared on their faces as they rose on the wind without hesitation. Watched by all, they neared the sky, waiting for the purple-black expanse to fully reveal the magnificent, sky-spanning profound river within the glazed light.

Li Jiangqian shielded himself with his divine ability, his body sinking as he moved through the light of True Qi. As he reached the glazed expanse, his heart stirred, and he slowly raised his head, activating his Spirit Probe.

He did not descend into the strange grotto-heaven, nor did he scan the horizon. Instead, he seized the chance to shoot upward, colliding abruptly with the strange, vase-like Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel hanging in the sky!

The faint layer of Exiled Qi covering the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was as nothing before his Spirit Probe and shattered in an instant. The aura of this treasure, refined with the Song Emperor's own life-mandate, was finally revealed.

Li Jiangqian felt a chill pervade his body. The object before him condensed countless terrifying powers, an aura of unprecedented horror that surpassed the imagination. The feedback from his Spirit Probe was not a simple reading, but a flood of visions.

Towering immortal mountains, a rain of heavenly flowers, Daoists refining pills and ascending upon consumption... the visions shook him, his eyes burning bright. A white crane carrying fruit, a stone ape knocking at a gate... all these scenes threatened to smash into his mind. The boundless pressure, unlike anything he had ever felt, seemed intent on destroying his very eyes, yet the karmic connection was instantly erased by his Spirit Probe!

In an instant, he fell naturally into the grotto-heaven, losing all sensation of the outside world.

Before him was an endless profound river that spanned the heavens.

Li Jiangqian appeared captivated, looking up as if in appreciation, but his heart was filled with an unimaginable, lingering fear. This power, so deeply entangled with his very life-mandate that it chilled him to the bone, seemed to be warning him on the level of his True Spirit.

'This is a Spiritual Treasure?'

Forget a Spiritual Treasure; with power like this, it would be no exaggeration to tell Li Jiangqian he had just stared down a True Monarch or swallowed Metallic Essence!

'That isn't some Purple Mansion Realm Spiritual Treasure re-refined with the Song Emperor's life-mandate... A Purple Mansion Realm Spiritual Treasure could never possess such power...'

'That is a Dharma Treasure!'

'This Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel... is very likely the same one wielded by True Monarch Tianwu all those years ago! It's a true Golden Core Dharma Treasure!'

What shocked him even more in realization was that the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was no ordinary Dharma Treasure. It was a Rank Designation of the True Qi position! It was something a True Monarch acquired by pledging their own status to a Fruition Attainment!

'Back then, Daoist Master Ning came to the lake and privately told Father that the True Monarch had passed away beyond the Heavens, causing the True Qi position to lose its master and this item to shatter and return... But... but it was in the Underworld's hands all along...'

His heart grew dark and cold as ice, and with it came a dreadful enlightenment.

'The Underworld... possesses such profound power! Did they get it after True Monarch Tianwu passed? Or... was it when Anhuai Heaven fell?! They actually have the original Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel!'

'If even the Rank Designation Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel is here, could the Martial Seal of Authority and Karma and the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip also be in the Underworld's possession? Only Ning Wan offered the dragon tendon... does that mean only the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip is not in Their hands?'

'No wonder Mount Changhuai is completely uninterested, and the Dragon-kin remain silent. This primary seat of True Qi... who could possibly contend with the Underworld for it!'
