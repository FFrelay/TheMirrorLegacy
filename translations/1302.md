# Chapter 1302: The Rising Tide

As the figures of Tianque and the others dissipated, the fierce flames in the sky grew even brighter. Despite the scattering rain, they did not waver in the slightest. Tianque's gaze gradually calmed, and strings of blazing red fire lit up within his eyes:

Governing Life Spirit.

Simultaneously, an endless fire like a celestial path unfurled from his feet to the front of the straw-caped elder. Tianque's face was bright with True Fire, and his fist crossed all radiance, arriving in an instant—it was already before Xiao Chuting!

In truth, he, Tianque, possessed one less divine ability than Xiao Chuting and was heavily suppressed within this grotto-heaven. Yet he remained unyielding, daring to strike first and seize control of the enemy!

The old man's expression remained unchanged, but his figure moved like a phantom, always maintaining a one-foot distance from the roiling, crimson-flamed fist that carved a long path of heavenly fire across the sky, yet from both sides, range upon range of perilous mountains converged.

Position Follows Peril.

From the layered mountains, countless waterfalls cascaded down like flexible grey ropes, coiling around his fist and binding the True Fire. How could Tianque relent? The flames in his eyes brightened instantly, streaming down his cheeks.

Heaven-Encompassing Fire!

He used these flames to break free from the perilous mountains, landing hundreds of punches on the Pit Water in a single instant. But the very moment his divine ability flared, the man before him had already sunk into the dense black clouds and vanished.

'Darkening Clouds...'

Tianque’s fighting style was direct and straightforward, yet after several exchanges, not a single punch had landed true. Clearly displeased, he immediately raised a hand to his waist and drew out a golden token.

This golden token was extremely peculiar. It was about three fingers wide and stuck fast between the pads of two of his fingers. As his arm swept, its sharp point tore open the sky as if ripping a fissure, from which gushed a bright golden, blazing conflagration!

His scorching, flame-filled eyes looked over as he said coldly,

"Daoist Friend Xiao!"

But what answered him was a roiling in the center of the water mist, as if parting the dense, gloomy clouds. The old man's figure had long since vanished, and a woman stepped out.

This person was remarkably tall, with her hair bound by a hairpin. Her features were exceptionally fine, her eyes gentle, and her face fair. At the center of her brow was a small, golden osmanthus pattern that seemed to shimmer with moonlight.

Most peculiar were the faint, tear-track-like moonlight patterns on her cheeks, which flickered with her breathing. As the wind buffeted her wide Daoist robes, patterns of the bright moon were revealed. Her voice was gentle and kind.

"Senior, why must you be so incensed?"

In that instant, Tianque's movement stalled in mid-air. For a rare moment, a trace of hesitation appeared in his eyes. He raised an eyebrow and said,

"Fairy Han Ling... Congratulations, Fairy."

"Senior is too kind."

The abundant Mansion Water had already surged up, trapping his rolling True Fire in mid-air. She pressed her hand to the sword at her waist, her voice exceptionally calm.

"It was a fortunate coincidence. This Purple Mystery trapped me for ninety-one years, and now I have finally passed it. With the Great Tomb River having opened, water-virtue cultivators from all under heaven are gathering from every direction. I, too, had to come."

Tianque stared at her, the flames on his body flaring ever brighter.

"I wonder what skill Daoist Master Xiao possesses, to convince a scion of True Monarch Yuanxia to intervene."

His words carried a trace of respect—the woman before him was none other than a Daoist Master of the Han Clan from Chang Prefecture!

The Han Clan of Chang Prefecture had cultivated the Three Yins for generations; they were the bloodline of True Monarch Yuanxia. And True Monarch Yuanxia was none other than a great cultivator of Supreme Yin from the ancient Encompassing Profundity, the second disciple of the Lord of Encompassing Profundity!

The Zhang family's background was certainly formidable, belonging to the great Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition... but if speaking purely of noble bloodlines, even Tianque was a step below the woman standing before him.

'Based on bloodline alone, she could even be compared to my own True Monarch's previous-life lineage...'

Moreover, True Monarch Yuanxia had been a kind person with numerous disciples, including the famed Thirteen Immortals of Woven Jade. He often enjoyed giving pointers and helping others resolve their difficulties, forging bonds within all the major Daoist Traditions. Many prominent figures had received his aid, resulting in excellent karmic affinity.

But He himself rarely watched over his clan and left behind no great treasures. As a result, through successive generations of turmoil, the Han Clan never produced a figure who reached the True Monarch level. At most, they cultivated to Woven Jade or formed a Divine Core, and thus they never encroached upon the interests of any other powers.

Because of this, during the years of upheaval within the Three Profoundities, when countless changes occurred and the fighting tore the world apart, it was not uncommon for other, equally noble bloodlines to decline or be severed. Yet no matter which power rose to dominance, they almost always ensured the Han Clan was well-settled. Consequently, their line has been passed down to this day with numerous disciples, so Tianque naturally would not dare to slight her!

The osmanthus pattern on Han Ling's brow flickered for a moment as she said softly,

"It is not a matter of his skill. This junior has a heart for seeking the Dao and merely wishes to observe Senior Xiao verifying the Dao. That is all."

Tianque's gaze fixed, meeting her clear and resolute eyes. In that instant, his heart grew complicated.

Water and fire mutually verified one another. His, Tianque's, True Fire was in a remarkably similar situation to Han Ling's Mansion Water. Han Ling's words were not wrong; for a cultivator intent on seeking the Dao, this reason was enough!

He nodded lightly.

"Fine! That is all."

Tianque showed not the slightest mercy. The golden token in his hand continued to wave. The fissure instantly tore wider, and flames poured from it like a waterfall, encircling him and making him appear as a deity.

The intense flames swallowed everything, even isolating a small world within this grotto-heaven. It faintly reduced the grotto-heaven's buffeting influence on him, as the entirety of his power bore down on the woman before him!

"Boom!"

Water and fire intertwined, reflecting in the old man's pupils. Xiao Chuting's gaze held not the slightest surprise, only an endless, icy calm.

'Good, she has made her move.'

'Han Ling only just broke through to Great Daoist Master. She is no match for Tianque, who holds the Blazing Fire Golden Pivot... I must remain on guard.'

His gaze quickly shifted from the water and fire to the person before him. This man had refined features and a very tall build, and he wore boots of black cloud. His entire bearing was clean and sharp, with the power of a divine ability surging beneath his calm exterior.

This Great Daoist Master cupped his hands in salute and said softly,

"Pardon the offense."

Without another word, surging radiance gathered. Facing the perfection of the Pit Water divine ability, this Great Daoist Master drew his saber.

A bright red blade of light pierced the sky, like a Heavenly Beam descending from above. Hidden beneath that radiance was an extremely dense azure cloud.

Another red-robed man arrived like a spring, illuminating everything in his path.

'Wu Gao, Danyin.'

These two Great Daoist Masters from Western Shu advanced on the clouds, their approach exceedingly cautious. Yet Xiao Chuting did not even raise an eyelid, merely stepping forward, which made Danyin's eyes flash for a moment.

'Who?'

'Who could make him so confident!'

Just as this blood-red light, like a heavenly punishment, was about to descend, a dense Pure Qi swept in from the east, blocking the two men. The man before them wore wide-sleeved robes, a gourd tied at his waist, and a stone tablet strapped to his back. His sleeves were slightly scorched, yet he still possessed a transcendent, immortal-like bearing, causing the two attackers to freeze.

'Him... why is it him!'

It was actually Chiguang!

If it had been Yang Ruiyi, or even Li Zhouwei, the two would not have been the least bit suspicious. But this person before them had no connection to Xiao Chuting whatsoever—or if he did, it certainly wasn't a good one!

Danyin's gaze was filled with shock as his voice thundered.

"Daoist Friend Chiguang—what is the meaning of this!"

Hearing the words 'Daoist Friend', a rare trace of sarcasm appeared on Chiguang's perpetually merciless face. He did not answer the question, but instead chuckled.

"Even a Gathering Wood dares to impersonate a Great Daoist Master."

This remark was both sarcastic and cold, and spoken in front of nearly half the great cultivators in the world. Danyin's eyes filled with disbelief, and his face instantly turned ugly.

Wu Gao's gaze, however, had already fixed on Han Ling in the distance, and understanding slowly dawned.

Daoist Master Chiguang was a guest of honor of the Han Clan. On his path to prominence, this Daoist Master from Jin had received immense help from the Han Clan. The fact that Chiguang had not been stifled in his infancy, and that the Overlook Township Pavilion had been able to secure a foothold in the Jin territory of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, was all thanks to the Han Clan's dedicated support!

'He has no personal likes or dislikes, but since the Han Clan has taken a stance, he will definitely stand with them. Furthermore, he cultivates Pure Qi!'

'Pure Qi is the progenitor of the Dao and its virtue, possessing the merit of Dao-accomplishment. Even if his cultivation is no longer the orthodox Immortal Dao, he would never pass up an opportunity to accumulate his own conceptual-aspect!'

But everyone's attention had already moved on. Xiao Chuting was still advancing. As he approached step by step, as if in response to some formless existence, the cold, dark, and boundless prison beneath his feet began to slowly tremble.

At this moment, however, Xiao Chuting finally stopped. A soft sigh echoed across the sky.

"Daoist Friend Murong... do you also intend to stop me?"

He raised his head. In the sky, a gloomy water mist had already obscured the rain clouds. Within that mist, a massive, somber object seemed to be approaching rapidly, breaking through all concealment to reveal its form.

It was a palm.

This palm filled the sky, impossibly vast. As various divine abilities flashed across it, this was finally a Daoist technique that possessed enough substance to seem significant before the Judgement Prison.

Xiao Chuting's gaze traversed the heavy mist and saw the person standing in the shadows—hair unbound, cuffs embroidered with scriptures, and emanating a faint, ghostly light, appearing quite aged.

This was also an old man, seemingly ordinary. But the yin water behind him connected heaven and earth, splitting into five streams that filled the eyes of every divine ability user below, striking shock into their hearts.

Perfected divine ability, complete in all five methods.

Murong Weidian.

'His divine ability is perfected!'

The world has changed countless times and True Monarchs no longer appear; the peak of immortal cultivation in the mortal realm is the divine ability. The status of one who has perfected their divine ability and completed all five methods has fluctuated since ancient times, but it has never been considered low!

Perfected divine ability was the minimum threshold for ancient cultivators to advance to the Divine Core. Such figures were also the only ones qualified to sit before a True Monarch and relay messages on their behalf!

The shadow of the Valley Water enveloped the surroundings, yet the old man in the straw cloak alone showed no change in expression.

This Daoist Master Murong cultivated in the north of the Yan Kingdom. He was one of the Murong family's few pure immortal cultivators and the current Yan Emperor's own grand-uncle. He cultivated Valley Water, and because of his proximity to the Northern Sea, he and Xiao Chuting had discussed the Dao for many years. Of all the Great Daoist Masters within the grotto-heaven, he was the most familiar with Xiao Chuting.

Xiao Chuting had also long known that his divine ability was perfected.

Yet the old man who had once discussed the Dao with him at the Cangzhou banquet had ultimately taken a stand against him, becoming the first perfected divine ability cultivator to intervene.

He simply raised his hand, holding two fingers together before him, and said softly,

"Entering the pit, coming and going, beset by perils. If the yin water does not overflow, why must there be hardship?"

In an instant, the constantly rising water level throughout the grotto-heaven seemed to stagnate. Vast waves surged from every corner of the world, all gathering beside the elder. The water beneath his feet suddenly depressed, forming an imprint of the celestial palm upon the vast sea, stretching from east to west.

"Drip."

The vast power from the sky seemed to plunge into bottomless depths. The giant palm sank into its watery imprint without a single great wave or thunderous sound. There was only the light sound of water as it transformed into a fine drizzle, scattering upon the old man's straw cloak.

Xiao Chuting gazed toward the horizon.

Murong Weidian's aged face was downcast. Facing his old friend's words, he closed his eyes. The light of the Valley Water gathered around him. His lips were tightly shut, yet inexplicably, his voice emerged, extremely soft.

"By both sentiment and reason, I should be helping you achieve your goal, Daoist Friend."

The old man sat cross-legged upon the clouds, but from the shadow behind him, a person turned, flicked his sleeves, and stepped forward with his hands clasped behind his back.

The youth was dashing and elegant, his powdered face touched with rouge, and he bore the likeness of a young Murong Weidian. He was draped in robes of white and red, tied with a sash at his waist. In one hand he held a sword, heavy and bladeless, which rested upon his other, empty hand. His crimson lips parted slightly,

"But my surname is Murong. I am a Dharma Protector of the Yan Kingdom. The Emperor's command is difficult to defy."

As the last word echoed in the air, the sword in his hand flared with light.

This Dharma Protector Daoist Master of the Yan Kingdom—was shockingly a great cultivator whose Dao-Profundity in sword techniques was exceptionally high!

Xiao Chuting was the one verifying the Dao here, but who among those who had come to this grotto-heaven was not a world-class talent? Murong Weidian had risen as a youth, cultivated the Dao until his old age guarding the northern lands, and had never known defeat; he was a peerless prodigy who suppressed the entire cultivation world of the Yan Kingdom by himself!

The world before Xiao Chuting's eyes had split in two. One half was roiling, layered dark clouds stretching for unknown thousands of miles. The other half was a boundless expanse of black water, like an ocean beyond the sea. The rift between them formed a narrow passage.

At the far end of that passage, on one side, stood the handsome and elegant youth, turned sideways with his sword in one hand, his gaze resolute, pointing directly at Xiao Chuting's brow. On the other side, the old man sat cross-legged, his exposed and aged half-face mottled and deathly still, his hands pressed together in prayer.

It was as if only these two existed in the entire world!

Illuminated by the endless Valley Water, Xiao Chuting had to simultaneously face Murong Weidian as the high-spirited Second Prince renowned throughout the Yan Kingdom, and Murong Weidian as the frost-weathered Great Daoist Master who guarded the northern frontier!

Xiao Chuting was finally moved, and he exclaimed in admiration,

"Your Valley Water divine ability has already reached the pinnacle."

At the other end, the old man remained silent with his hands pressed together, but the youth's voice rang out, bright and spirited with a unique, vigorous air.

"We have discussed the Dao for many years, yet we have never fought with our full strength. For you to verify the Dao now, Daoist Friend... it is truly a pity!"

"A pity!"

Xiao Chuting gazed at him from afar, his eyes indeed holding a trace of admiration. He smiled, shook his head, and said quietly,

"A pity indeed, but today I cannot indulge you, Daoist Friend."

All eyes focused on him, only to discover that, at some unknown point, someone else had appeared by the old man's side.

This person had the appearance of a young man, his robes fluttering and long hair unbound. He held a string of black pearls in his hand, and a bronze cauldron rested quietly at his waist, emitting the flickering light of Pristine Water.

His eyes were slightly narrow and his nose high-bridged. Those eyes were a brimming, vivid jade, like a pool clear to its bottom, yet they glittered with a cold light.

A trace of surprise appeared on Murong Weidian's youthful face. His brightly colored eyes focused on the newcomer.

"Chi Buzi?"
