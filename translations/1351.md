# Chapter 1351: Beset by Foes, Within and Without

"Very well."

Longkang Yao's utterly placid voice echoed through the air. He set down the Pang Yi he was holding, his gaze sweeping over the people to his left and right before he took a step forward, turned, and presented his back to everyone.

"I will remember your words."

A chill crept into Fu He's heart as he heard this, and he slowly lowered his head.

Yet Longkang Yao stood quietly in place, seemingly waiting for something. But the world held only the tranquil lake and the brilliant sunset glow, which bathed everything in a crimson hue; not a single figure appeared on the far side of the water.

The earlier words buzzed around his ears like flies, dissolving in the depths of Longkang Yao's heart and leaving behind but one emotion.

Disappointment.

Who was he, Longkang Yao?

There were quite a few descendants of Comprehending Profundity in the present day. Great divine ability users like Guanhua and Shuolou of [Overlooking Gaze Perceiving the Profound] had also left surnames behind. However, whether it was the Wei clan or the Loutai clan, these people were simply incomparable to his Longkang clan.

For according to the records of Zhaoyao Mountain, those True Monarchs had left no direct heirs at all!

The current Wei and Loutai clans were merely the descendants of those True Monarchs' kinsmen. Though their bloodline was certainly noble, there was nothing truly profound about it. While their ancestors had cultivated for generations, nurturing their innate talents, they were, in the end, just clansmen.

But True Monarch Shen Qiang had a son.

And he, Longkang Yao, could trace his lineage with absolute clarity to a specific child of that True Monarch's eldest son, and to a precise branch among that child's descendants. The Longkang clan members in Blazing Aridity Heaven today could be counted on one's fingers. Those in the Purple Mansion Realm were fewer still, and he was the only Great Daoist Master. To put it bluntly, he, Longkang Yao, held the legacy of True Monarch Shen Qiang in his hands, and the immortal blood of the Blazing Fire of Aridity flowed through his veins!

Thus, among the many descendants of Comprehending Profundity in the world today, he, Longkang Yao, had to give face to no one. If he stood upon Zhaoyao Mountain, the only one who could stand in the same rank as him was Xueyang!

Did he, Longkang Yao, not know that Gu Prefecture was a total mess?

Qu Caotan had run back from the Ji River faster than anyone. Could Longkang Yao not see that?

He stood here for the sake of these Daoist Traditions, for the sake of old loyalties, for the so-called dignity of the Three Profundities. Yet the people behind him, the great houses of Gu Prefecture, had all vanished. There were no figures, no words, only him, Longkang Yao, and a group of juniors whose allegiances were unclear, standing together in the pavilion.

Longkang Yao said faintly, "Fellow Daoist Lu!"

Lu An, who had been listening quietly from the side for so long, was already deeply shaken by the chain of events and had been secretly applauding. Hearing his name, he merely stepped forward and offered a salute, listening as the Great Daoist Master said.

"If I may trouble you..."

But his words came to an abrupt halt.

All the divine ability users in the hall seemed to sense something at once. They raised their heads toward the horizon and saw that the western sky was already aglow with a brilliant Heavenly Light. A pale golden radiance was veiled in clouds like a thin mist, and behind those clouds stood a magnificent Heavenly Gate that connected heaven and earth.

The Heavenly Audience Gate!

The Heavenly Gate was so close it seemed to be right before their eyes, so close that they could discern the various profound patterns carved upon its surface and the illusory figures of golden-armored, golden-robed sentinels standing amidst the clouds.

Li Zhouwei.

_Boom!_

It was as if all words exploded in Fu He's mind. His face turned deathly pale in an instant. He stared blankly at the Heavenly Gate standing just outside Chun City, and all the chaotic thoughts in his mind coalesced into a single, freezing certainty.

'He's here!'

'How is this possible... With his arrogance, his despotism... how could he possibly come? And since he was coming, Pang Yi... why did you have to argue with me for so long...'

A divine ability user traversed the Great Void and materialized outside the pavilion, bowing in alarm.

"Great Daoist Master! King Wei requests an audience outside the city!"

Longkang Yao turned his head and asked, "How many people came with him?"

The man lowered his head.

"He came alone!"

Longkang Yao stared at him for a moment without a word, without a hint of doubt. The Great Daoist Master's form then erupted like a burst of flame, vanishing without a trace!

Silence descended upon the courtyard once more, leaving only Pang Yi's slightly raised brow and the imperceptible curl of his lips. The cold sweat that had drenched his body finally ceased at this moment. There was no joy in his heart, only an endless, lingering terror.

How could he not also be relieved!

The Pang clan had already pushed things to the absolute limit!

Pang Yi was far too aware of his own predicament. From the moment Li Jiangqian had laid that overt scheme upon the table, he had anticipated what he would have to say, what gazes he would have to meet, and what fate awaited him. He had no fear for his own safety here. What he feared was that Li Zhouwei would turn on him, suspecting him, plotting against him!

Because... if he, Pang Yi, were in Li Zhouwei's position, would he have come to Chun City to prove anything?

He most certainly would not.

'If I were Li Zhouwei, I would surely make excuses and refuse, hide Gu You, and let Longkang Yao's suspicions fester...'

He, Pang Yi, had already betrayed his allies; his credibility was nonexistent. Once Li Zhouwei confirmed Fu He's theory, under the combined pressure from Fu Tanjian and Longkang Yao, with battles raging and Fu He watching like a hungry tiger, the likelihood of him, Pang Yi, being quietly disposed of was far too high.

'And Father would surely be sent to the front lines to atone for his crimes. As King Wei, I would then devise a plan to assassinate him. Only then would I release Gu You! I'd claim that Pang Queyun had screamed "Great Daoist Master Longkang has brought ruin upon me and my son!" three times before he was killed. For a man as proud and obsessed with his own perfection as Longkang Yao, such an act would surely fill him with gut-wrenching regret and force a permanent break with the Fu clan... It might even shatter his Dao-heart, make him side with the Pang clan, and carry this blood feud all the way to Dongmu Heaven's doorstep!'

'In this way, Gu You remains unharmed, Longkang is not offended, and Gu Prefecture is plunged into an irreconcilable schism. Fu Tanjian would lose all his standing, finding himself unable to advance or retreat, caught in an impossible situation. He would suffer a catastrophic setback and be utterly humiliated before Dongmu Heaven...'

'What's the use in scheming against Fu He? If you're going to harm someone, you should drag a direct disciple of a True Monarch like Fu Tanjian down into the mortal dust and persecute him. If you're going to destroy someone, you should obliterate the hope of Dao-accomplishment for a True Monarch's blood descendant like Longkang Yao. You must make the entire Daoist Tradition ache with pain; only then can it be called a true victory!'

'Make the Fu clan's actions a source of shame for both Blazing Aridity Heaven and Dongmu Heaven, an unspeakable rift between the two Daoist Traditions! Let the Fu clan's actions tear the whole of Gu Prefecture asunder, causing the death and injury of countless Daoist Masters—that is what I call skill! We'll see then who dares to trifle with me!'

As his penchant for venomous schemes flared up, he once again lamented that he was not Li Zhouwei, sighing repeatedly.

But it was precisely for this reason that Pang Yi was so worried Li Zhouwei would cast him aside like a worn-out shoe. Why else would he, before their grand plan had even succeeded, swear such an oath before His Highness, saying things that so clearly gave the man leverage over him?

It was simply a defense against being outmaneuvered!

While he was perfecting this vicious plot in his mind, those words—"He came alone!"—struck the heart of the nearby Fu He like a bolt of lightning. He was finally jolted from his stupor. He looked up at Pang Yi in utter disbelief, his voice trembling.

"You plotted against me... You and Bright Yang conspired to plot against me!"

Li Zhouwei's arrival was the key that unlocked all his questions. His voice was a mixture of shock and hatred, laced with the bone-deep chill of dawning comprehension.

"It was never about Gu Prefecture, and it wasn't about Longkang Yao... You deliberately abandoned Gu You. You colluded with Bright Yang to intentionally sell me the flaw of his being in perfect condition. This was all your scheme to lure the snake from its hole... Your target was me all along!"

Pang Yi did not spare him a single glance, only sweeping a cold gaze over him as one might look at a child.

Fu He, however, was genuinely grief-stricken. Tears streamed down his face as he removed his jade crown and cursed,

"Pang Yi! You and I cultivated together for thirty years; we were as close as brothers. And now, from the very beginning, you were scheming against me before I had even emerged from the grotto-heaven... You are truly the most venomous villain in the world!"

"What a cruel, black heart you have!"

These words, seething with enough hatred to kill, exploded in the air. Fu He's eyes were nearly splitting with rage. Pang Yi was momentarily stunned, feeling that something was slightly off, but he could only lift his head and say icily,

"Plotting? What is this nonsense? Since we are both wholeheartedly devoted to Gu Prefecture, we shall see who is right and who is wrong after the Great Daoist Master returns!"

...

The evening sun bathed Chun City in its light.

Longkang Yao strode through the Great Void to arrive before the man who was wreathed in Heavenly Light like a monarch. He quickly noticed something beside the man's throne—a dark, profound urn, actively being suppressed by a divine ability.

The fact that Li Zhouwei had come alone had already made everything clear. His feelings, surprisingly, were exceptionally complex.

There was none of the disdain from their first meeting, nor the regret from his own retreat, not even the fury of losing four territories. There was only a deeply complex emotion—was it hope? Or resignation? It was hard to say.

He said softly, "King Wei... you invited me west, yet you came east yourself."

Then he saw the Heavenly Light flicker once or twice, and the majestic yet deeply sarcastic voice of King Wei echoed back.

"The Great Daoist Master has such a distinguished guest under his command. How could I possibly impose?"

Longkang Yao did not know how to respond. The coldness seemed to vanish in an instant, leaving only a stark silence.

He was silent, but the White Qilin opposite him would not be. Li Zhouwei's voice grew steadily colder.

"The Longkang clan may not cherish a man of integrity, but this king laments the life of Daoist Master Gu. With his power alone, he broke the divine abilities of so many, allowing that multitude of Daoist Masters from Gu Prefecture to flee unscathed. Even if he refuses to serve me, this king would disdain to harm his divine ability or his life."

"To say nothing of allowing his magnificent divine ability to be harmed by villains."

Longkang Yao lowered his gaze. Listening to the other's sarcasm, he felt a knot tighten in his chest. In a rare moment of humility, he lowered his head and said faintly,

"This matter was... this Daoist Master's lack of foresight. The voices within the Prefecture claiming Bright Yang was harming people grew louder by the day... it was inevitable..."

"This king broke through four of your passes. Did I ever harm a single divine ability user?"

Longkang Yao was speechless.

Li Zhouwei sneered, "The Great Daoist Master is at his wit's end, cherishing his own face more than the safety of Gu Prefecture while he deliberates on whether or not to ask others to intervene. There is no need for such self-righteous excuses."

A peculiar gaze fell upon Longkang Yao. He had felt this King Wei's gaze of respect, the look one gives a formidable enemy. He had also felt his look of regret, as if letting a great disaster escape. But he had never imagined he would be the subject of this kind of stare.

Contempt.

"This king had thought... that the Great Daoist Master was a hero of his generation."

Longkang Yao's expression froze, his face burning with shame. He did not know how to explain, or perhaps he had no need to explain himself to this enemy chieftain. But in that instant, Longkang Yao understood exactly what this White Qilin was thinking.

It was, 'I never thought the Longkang clan could be so heartless and disloyal. Such a man of integrity, even this king treated him with care, unable to bear him any harm... yet you disregarded him completely.'

Or perhaps it was,

'His very life... you used it as a bargaining chip while you deliberated inviting another Daoist Tradition to interfere. A pity he remained loyal to the death—when next we meet, this king will seek justice for him!'

But this King Wei merely watched him coldly, speaking no more.

Longkang Yao stood rooted to the spot in a daze.

Longkang Yao held himself in extremely high regard. Facing this White Qilin of the mortal world, he had dared to show him no face at all, instead taking pride in being his rival, delighting in having thwarted his plans. But by that same token, when the White Qilin's disdainful gaze fell upon him, it was a humiliation of a different order entirely!

This humiliation was even more damaging than all the words that had been said before. Yet his opponent pointedly did not ask, not even giving Longkang Yao a chance to explain. He just laughed with biting sarcasm and said,

"That is correct. This king has come to return Gu You. I did not harm him. However, before my departure, though Daoist Master Yu consistently vouched for you, several of my divine ability users began to worry about the character of the Longkang clan. Considering Gu You's unwavering loyalty, we took the liberty of collecting all his Spiritual Treasures and other artifacts. He has on his person only the two swords that are stored within his dharma body, a precaution in case this king were to be ambushed by the Great Daoist Master..."

Longkang Yao's expression had already turned foul. He took a deep breath and sneered back,

"This Daoist Master's character... is hardly for the likes of you to..."

"Longkang Yao, you and I are not enemies."

King Wei cut him off, stating faintly,

"What this king desired, I have now obtained. I shall be leaving shortly. My grand-uncle will personally travel to Gu Prefecture to return Daoist Master Gu's treasures—and also those of the Daoist Master Wen. I know nothing of the Great Daoist Master's character, but Daoist Master Yu can be trusted."

He did not utter another half-sentence, dissipating like a ray of light, so swiftly, so unexpectedly, that Longkang Yao, who had been gathering his words, looked up with a start.

_Boom!_

But what thundered in that spot was the roaring of water. In Li Zhouwei's place, a rampant torrent of Converging Water surged toward the heavens like a wild horse breaking free of its reins!

An azure-grey light flooded the surroundings, as if connecting to an infinite sea. Only then could one see a figure with twin swords on his back striding out step by step from the depths!

Gu You!

The Great Daoist Master of Converging Water's face was incomparably calm, without a trace of surprise, yet his hands were clenched into iron fists. He did not chase the Heavenly Light on the horizon, nor did he look up. He merely stood, staring straight ahead.

His aura was at its absolute peak!

The injuries he had sustained were not severe to begin with, and his Converging Water divine ability had been constantly replenishing his dharma power. After these past few days of recuperation with Valley Water, just by emerging into the world, his aura already seemed to be nearing its perfect state!

At this moment, Longkang Yao's eyes were finally clear as glass. Li Zhouwei's disdainful gaze was still vivid in his mind, like a spark igniting the inferno of rage in his chest, causing his teeth to grind together.

He had lost the contest and lost his dignity, utterly shamed and disgraced!

'Fu He... Fu Tanjian... Excellent... such excellent methods!'

At the very peak of his fury, his first instinct was not to show concern for Gu You. Instead, he stood ramrod straight, and an unknown amount of time passed before he finally caught his breath and looked toward the man beside him.

Perhaps Gu You had heard everything that had transpired outside, or perhaps a fellow Daoist had entered the Spiritual Treasure to speak with him. There was not the slightest hint of confusion on the Daoist Master's face, only a profound placidity.

Gu You had already unslung the twin swords from his back. He gripped the waists of both blades in one hand, while clear Converging Water swirled in his other, continuously wiping the sharp, intersecting edges.

"I hear..."

The Great Daoist Master of Converging Water did not raise his head, his gaze fixed deeply on the blades. The black pupils of his eyes narrowed slightly, and terrifying currents of water swirled around him like silken threads...

He spoke softly, calmly,

"Someone wishes for me, Gu, to die."
