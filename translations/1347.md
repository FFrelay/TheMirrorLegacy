# Chapter 1347: Co-conspirators

As the morning sun rose, the land was gradually bathed in a golden light. Atop the towering pass, a man in black robes faced the morning glow, while beside him, the Great Daoist Master of Purple Qi stood slightly turned, his head bowed in a gesture of respect.

The two passes had been breached, and Li Zhouwei pressed his advantage forward. Although these two passes were exceedingly treacherous; once through them, the remaining lands were a wide, flat plain. Many of these areas lacked formations entirely, and even those that had them were broken with but a light encirclement.

Yet Li Zhouwei proceeded with a steady and deliberate pace, taking a full day to consolidate his control over several territories before arriving at E'ye. From this place, one could already see several great mountains, and nestled within their embrace, a city of profound mystery.

He stood upon the pass, gazing down from afar, and waited another day. He used Spirit Probe to investigate, delving deep into the city and observing the spiritual dwellings within. He saw a jade box, resplendent upon a roof beam, the talisman inside it shifting ceaselessly.

His heart sank slightly, and he turned as if by chance, smiling as he asked,

"Within Chun City... are there any famous immortal residences?"

Yu Xixin clasped his hands and hurriedly replied,

"Naturally, there are many... As the saying goes: every house and tile is touched by immortal light, every palace and chamber is especially blessed. Although much has been damaged, many places still possess deep historical connections. There is the Calamity Dispelling Palace where Emperor Liang once stayed, the Decree Responding Terrace favored by the Purple Qi, and even the Wandering Metal's former home, the Divine Ability Township, and the Wenhuang Residence, illuminated by the Reflecting Metal..."

Li Zhouwei looked up, feigning great interest, "Wandering Metal... Reflecting Metal... Are you referring to the two of the current age?"

"The Wandering Metal... is, of course. For all these years, no one has dared to touch that former residence of his; only members of the Wang family have returned. As for the Reflecting Metal, however, it does not refer to one of the Zhang family."

Since it wasn't one of the Golden Unity, the meaning was worth pondering. Li Zhouwei spoke in a low voice, "The one from Sword Gate?"

Yu Xixin sighed and shook his head.

"It was someone from an even earlier time..."

He solemnly straightened his robes, seeming to gather his words, and only after a long moment of hesitation did he speak.

"The Daoist Master must know that my Yu clan are descendants of the Donghua. The disciple of the Azure Profundity's Master, Changtang, was my earliest ancestor."

Li Zhouwei looked directly at him and said softly, "Of course I know... My Li family is based at Moongaze Lake."

'Moongaze Marsh...'

This seemed to touch upon some tacit understanding between the two. Yu Xixin lowered his gaze, not meeting Li Zhouwei's eyes, and soon closed them as if sensing something, then answered,

"Yes... The Cloud Dream of Moongaze was once my Donghua Daoist Tradition's sacred court, the Dao-precinct of True Monarch Changtang. At that time, people of the world traveled between the north and south, and also called it Dong Court."

Li Zhouwei stiffened slightly.

Yu Xixin continued, "Since King Wei has come from Jiangnan, you must know that the Green Pine Temple rose and fell three times. The third time was under the Gonghua Dao-path, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. The second time... was the Yanhua... to call it Donghua would not be an overstatement, and this True Monarch of Reflecting Metal was a figure from the temple during that era."

Li Zhouwei seemed lost in thought, and asked, "Do you know his Daoist title?"

"This was a very, very long time ago, and it involved a struggle between Daoist traditions, a battle for a position of honor. The people of the world should be unaware... But we, being of the Donghua, have passed down certain records... This person is an ancestor my bloodline can remember, so naturally, I know!"

"Under the Yanhua, his Daoist title was..."

Yu Xixin raised his head and murmured, "Taihong."

The expression in Li Zhouwei’s eyes froze. He looked up and asked with doubt, "How could he be of that generation!"

After all, when the Green Pine Temple rose for the third time, it was the True Monarchs of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who belonged to the 'Tai' generation. That being the case, the so-called Yanhua Daoist tradition from so long ago... should not, by rights, share the same generational character!

Yu Xixin gave a wry smile and shook his head, saying,

"It was always meant to be the 'Tai' generation. It was only because Lord Yingze's seniority was so high that the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's generation was elevated... The details of the Green Pine Temple's rise and fall are also a secret, so many cultivators thought my ancestor was a disciple-brother of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... This caused a great deal of trouble, so it was rarely mentioned later on..."

Li Zhouwei's doubts vanished, but another name suddenly surfaced in his mind.

'Taiyuan.'

Wang Ziya's words in the Great Void still echoed in his ears, and the information Li Quewan had obtained from the Golden Unity Daoist Tradition was fresh in his memory. This King Wei quickly grew suspicious.

'If so, could the Daoist tradition Taiyuan obtained be from the same era as this True Monarch Taihong?'

He had too little information, so he fell silent for a moment and quickly abandoned that line of thought. Instead, he shifted his attention back to this place itself and said softly,

"In that case, fellow Daoist, you must be quite familiar with this Wenhuang Residence."

Yu Xixin was startled at first, but hearing the interest in his tone, he reconsidered. It was only normal for this man to be curious about the ancestral lands of his own Daoist court. He thus said seriously,

"Although the True Monarch cultivates Reflecting Metal, this place possesses the power of yin and yang transformation, of the blending of water and fire. For many years, it has enveloped the residence, and those high-level cultivators who harmonize yin and yang, or possess divine abilities that temper water and fire, all love to come to the Wenhuang Residence to cultivate..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"Oh? It sounds like a fine place."

Yu Xixin nodded thoughtfully. A southern light was already speeding towards them, and two Daoist Masters landed on the mountain one after the other. The one in the lead was cloaked in the light of the Lesser Yin, a smile on his face, while the person behind him was older but wore an equally joyous expression. Together, they bowed and said,

"We pay our respects to King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei focused his gaze.

"Has Mount Rao been taken?"

"It has been taken! Daoist Master Sima and His Highness are standing guard!"

Qiao Wenliu stood up, his face filled with exhilaration as he said,

"Before the two passes were even breached, Longkang Yao withdrew on his own. He is quite capable, escorting those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators away with him and leaving the formations empty. But that man is stubborn; we invited fellow Daoist Wu to go inside and persuade him, but he couldn't be moved. After he held out for a while, we sent fellow Daoist Xun in, and that local Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Daoist Master Yu, finally surrendered the city!"

Hearing that the grand formation was preserved intact, Li Zhouwei nodded slightly.

In truth, the battles between the two sides had so far been kept to a limited intensity. Aside from the swift resolution at Mount Jiao, no other grand formation had been easily destroyed, let alone a gateway like Mount Rao.

This was partly due to the various families not being of one mind, but it was also a result of Li Zhouwei's deliberate actions.

Now, as he was still on the second pass, organizing his forces, the rapidly returned Qiao Wenliu recovered from his great joy, but couldn't help feeling a little puzzled.

"As I see it, the various cultivators are currently disorganized, making this the perfect time to attack... I wonder about King Wei's injuries..."

Throughout the campaign, this Daoist Master Qiao had been his most stalwart supporter, which was why Li Zhouwei had entrusted him with handling the matter of Mount Rao. Qiao Wenliu's pockets were now much fuller, making his heart burn even hotter, still hungry for more.

More importantly, seeing the great families of Gu Prefecture routed and fleeing had left him feeling utterly triumphant. However, not having had the chance to humiliate them to their faces felt like scratching an itch through a boot, leaving him unsatisfied. Seeing Longkang Yao and the others retreat, and with time slipping by, he grew anxious, fearing that Li Zhouwei's injuries had not yet healed...

Now, with his heart itching unbearably and his face full of anxiety, he couldn't help but say,

"Although the four territories have been lost, Chun City is still Chun City. Longkang Yao cultivates Blazing Fire, and I don't know why the General let him go. We won't be able to catch him now, which was a great mistake. If we don't press forward urgently, I fear we may suffer a setback."

In truth, suppressing Gu You had indeed left considerable injuries, but they were by no means severe. With various restorative effects washing over him and having taken medicinal pills, Li Zhouwei had already caught his breath. What made him hesitate at the second pass was not the wounds on his body.

'Yang Ruiyi let Longkang Yao go.....'

This was something he had anticipated. After all, Yang Ruiyi had only acted because he had been manipulated by Li Jiangqian. It was even more unlikely that he would truly offend this Great Daoist Master, who ranked among the top in all of Gu Prefecture in terms of both power and background!

And there was nothing wrong with Qiao Wenliu's words; they could even be considered loyal advice. But Li Zhouwei's concern was not Chun City at all.

'With my army at the gates, the great families will not risk their direct descendants again. Even if they send out other Great Daoist Masters, they will either be killed by me or be subdued by me, which could be a good thing or a bad thing... The trouble is... Longkang Yao.'

'This man and Gu You are ultimately of the same background. Though not as stubborn as Gu You, he is quite proud and unwilling to bow his head...'

His thoughts were many and complex.

'Let me first devise a plan. It would be best if I could gain this person's assistance. Even if I can't, I must injure him so severely that he cannot defend, forcing him to negotiate with me about Gu You. After all, this Great Daoist Master of Converging Water absolutely cannot be killed. I must not push Longkang Yao into Qi Lanyan's position...'

'If I am forced to kill Gu You, then Longkang Yao... likewise cannot be spared...'

Qi Lanyan had a fundamental conflict with him, but that was not the case with Longkang Yao now. Ultimately, this person was still resisting based on his own pride and for the benefit of all of Gu Prefecture.

'Although he is thinking of Gu Prefecture's interests, these Daoist Masters of Gu Prefecture may not be thinking of him. If he were to fight to the death, it would truly be a problem.'

With Gu You in his grasp, Li Zhouwei already had the upper hand. He was reluctant to kill the Great Daoist Master of Converging Water, and Longkang Yao would only be more reluctant than he. Thus, he was in even less of a hurry, merely saying,

"Longkang Yao is faster, and his divine abilities and reputation are both great. Now that he has returned to Chun City and can command all the divine ability users, he is nothing like Pang Yi. If we are too hasty, I fear we may fall into his trap."

As he spoke, Yu Xixin, who had been calmly concentrating all this time, finally shook out his sleeves. The profound urn in his hand tilted, and a torrent of Converging Water rushed into the sky, transforming into a celestial phenomenon that filled the heavens!

For a moment, the vast sky became like an ocean as Gu You's divine ability leaked out. The Great Daoist Master of Purple Qi immediately raised his sleeve, and with his other hand, poured Valley Water into the urn, continuously suppressing the surging divine fluctuations within.

With this, he was visibly more at ease, constantly stabilizing the divine ability inside. Li Zhouwei looked up at the horizon.

'But no matter what... I must first have a bout with Longkang Yao.'

He knew this clearly. Seeing that he had suppressed Gu You, this Great Daoist Master of Longkang would certainly doubt his condition. Whether it was to continue applying pressure or to try and exchange Gu You for some benefit, he first had to fight a great battle with this True Monarch of Blazing Fire to display his own state.

After all, Yang Ruiyi letting Longkang Yao go back was equivalent to promising not to intervene further. If he, Li Zhouwei, had been seriously injured in the fight with Gu You, Longkang Yao would absolutely not mind leading the other Daoist Masters out again for a battle with him!

And he, Li Zhouwei, had waited outside the city for a full two days, feigning an overwhelming aura while halting his advance, precisely to lure the enemy into a trap.

'After all, a direct assault would be troublesome. It's better to first show weakness to the enemy... They won't believe I'm too heavily injured, but if the wounds are too light, they won't be willing to fight... Besides, Longkang Yao is already on his guard and won't be easily fooled, but there's no harm in trying to deceive him a bit...'

Li Zhouwei's only concern was that it was not easy for Yu Xixin to suppress Gu You. Once a great battle began and his concentration was broken, it was highly likely that the Great Daoist Master of Converging Water would escape.

He waited quietly for the better part of a day, and finally saw flames at the edge of the sky slowly brighten.

He simply stepped onto the light and rose, saying casually, "I shall go and test him first!"

In an instant, a brilliant Heavenly Gate illuminated the fertile fields, and armies of soldiers in golden armor and golden robes stood upon the clouds. An intense Bright Yang radiance poured down, and at almost the same moment, a surging Blazing Fire erupted from a distant mountain peak!

The two Great Daoist Masters exchanged no words, and with no warning, began to battle in the sky. For a time, the mountains shook, fire and light intertwined, and the two colors in the sky repeatedly tangled, causing the faces of the onlookers on the pass to change several times.

_Boom!_

Amidst the scorching heavenly light, King Wei's laughter actually rang out,

"The Daoist Master's spiritual body is afflicted and has yet to heal, yet you move so recklessly!"

Longkang Yao had first returned from the east with minor injuries, then fought a great battle with Yang Ruiyi. Although the Great General of the Great Song had not managed to inflict much damage on him, it had interrupted his recovery time. The two factors combined had actually left his condition even worse.

King Wei's speculation was confirmed, and his various heavenly lights became increasingly sharp. Yet Longkang Yao did not fall behind, retorting with a cold laugh,

"Your injuries are not light either, fellow Daoist... Without those Daoist Masters to pin me down for you, how will you defeat me this time?"

One was impervious to all techniques, the other had a body like iron and stone. Li Zhouwei had already discerned his divine ability, but Longkang Yao also knew the killing moves of the Bright Yang. Thus, the sky and earth darkened, sand and stones flew, and divine abilities intertwined like waterfalls, yet neither could gain the upper hand over the other, prompting many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to sit cross-legged and observe closely.

But amid the fading light, a thread-thin stream of golden water shot across the sky, swiftly approaching the city wall and materializing above it. A man in a white-gold Daoist robe stepped out!

Li Ximing!

He had rushed all this way, sparing no expenditure of his divine ability. The Valley Water Spiritual Artifact had been pushed to its limit, causing his face to appear slightly pale. Seeing the Bright Yang and Blazing Fire locked in combat in the sky, his heart shook!

He stared for a moment, and finally hesitated no longer. While raising a barrier of heavenly light, he reached into his sleeve and slowly crushed the jade talisman.

_Boom!_

In an instant, all the heavenly light in the sky suddenly converged and then exploded violently amidst the roiling flames. A thick darkness enveloped the sky, and the figure in black abruptly retreated!

"Hm?"

This was utterly unexpected. The Blazing Fire in the sky also faltered for a moment. Seeing several divine abilities leap up from E'ye to receive him, divine abilities simultaneously lit up from within Gu Prefecture, and the situation became tense as a drawn bow!

Longkang Yao frowned. His goal of probing had been achieved. He finally waved his hand and rode the wind back into the city.

And Li Zhouwei returned on a ray of light, his expression unchanged. The gazes of the crowd shifted, and for a moment, all fell upon Li Ximing. Seeing his mourning attire of sackcloth, they all understood.

'I heard... that the Li family has an elder of an extremely high generation, this Daoist Master's own grandfather... He left at that time for his sake... Now he has returned with bad news...'

As Li Ximing passed before the crowd, he heard only great sighs and a series of low 'condolences' and laments. His face was streaked with tears. Li Zhouwei likewise dismissed the crowd and entered the main hall within the spiritual formation with his great-uncle. After coughing lightly twice and spitting out two mouthfuls of fire, he finally said,

"How are things?"

Li Ximing's face was pale, his attire making the situation obvious, but he didn't even have time to announce the death. He only lowered his voice and used a divine ability to transmit his words.

'There is news from the lake...'

'People from the grotto-heaven are about to arrive. Jiang Yan will emerge from seclusion in a few days. There is a change in the West Palace. Troops in the Shu region are on the move and have reached the great desert. There is a danger of the formation being breached. Please return quickly.'

Li Zhouwei, who had just sat down, shot straight up. His golden eyes stared fixedly at Li Ximing, his expression changing several times!

Who else could this message be from!

While campaigning in the north, Li Zhouwei had been calm and composed, never before showing such an ugly expression. He remained silent for a long time, his demeanor eventually turning to ice.

All distracting thoughts vanished from his mind, which suddenly rang with a realization:

Yang Ruiyi is leaving.

He paced rapidly around the hall, seemingly gleaning a great deal of information from that single sentence and inferring various changes. He looked at his great-uncle and said urgently:

"Great-uncle, please go out at once and ask Wu Miao... no, bring Yu Xixin to me!"

...

"Congratulations, my lord!"

"Great One... you fought so well King Wei had no choice but to temporarily withdraw..."

Amidst a chorus of voices, Longkang Yao, who had just descended from the sky, wore a cold expression, devoid of any pride. He glanced around at the people thronging him, frowned, and said flatly,

"Enough!"

The surroundings immediately fell silent.

Longkang Yao's mood was somewhat detached.

'I showed weakness, and managed to fight him to a draw... I don't know how much of it was real... But it doesn't matter. Yu Xixin must be focused on suppressing Gu You, and probably can't spare much strength...'

In their brief exchange, King Wei's condition was almost exactly as he had imagined. He was clearly not as sharp as he had been during their previous battle, but his foundation had not been shaken.

'No wonder he dares to stand guard outside the city even when injured!'

Pang Yi, seeing that the situation was not right, dismissed the various divine ability users on his behalf and led him inside. Returning to the lakeside, Fu He was still waiting for him, looking very anxious.

"Great Daoist Master! He..."

Longkang Yao gave him no chance to speak, saying coldly, "Li Zhouwei is not in good condition. I suppressed him without using my full strength. With our defenses, we are more than capable of protecting Chun City. You've troubled your father to worry for nothing!"

Longkang Yao's words were decisive and allowed no argument. Fu He, seeing that he could not persuade him for the moment, felt a surge of disappointment in his heart and secretly clenched his teeth. He was about to speak again when he heard laughter from outside.

A man had already sped over, landing by the lake and saying with a cupped-fist salute and a smile,

"Fellow Daoists, it has been a long time!"

This person was dressed as a Daoist priest, with a handsome appearance and a golden sword at his waist. He approached with a carefree air, his face wreathed in smiles.

It was Lu An!

The Lu family also carried significant weight. At his appearance, several people politely returned the salute. Only Longkang Yao sat bolt upright in his seat, not even glancing at him.

The reason was simple: Lu An's adopted son was Bian Fan!

This Daoist Master Bian Fan had personally controlled the Great Void in the east to help Li Zhouwei ambush Longkang Yao. Although he had not acted directly, it was an extremely disgusting affair. If not for this person and his formation, how could he, Longkang Yao, with all his divine abilities, have retreated in such a sorry state?

That he wasn't cursing loudly now was already Longkang Yao showing the Lu family face!

Lu An was not good-tempered by nature, but being in the wrong at this moment, he could only soften his stance. He sighed and moved closer, saluting with his hands.

"My unworthy son has offended the Great One. Lu An's crime is immense!"

Longkang Yao still wore a cold expression—in truth, the ancestral relationship between the Lu and Longkang clans was excellent. Seeing the normally proud Daoist Master Lu willing to bend his back for once, his heart had already softened considerably, but he refused to relent on the surface, turning his head away.

Lu An smiled, took a step, and moved to face him directly again, saluting once more with a sigh.

"This junior cultivator apologizes to the Great One here!"

There were few who dared to make a member of the Lu family call himself a junior cultivator. Longkang Yao could no longer maintain his composure and cursed,

"You old scoundrel, are you trying to flatter me to death!"

Hearing this, Lu An knew the anger in the man's heart had subsided, and replied,

"I wouldn't dare... I wouldn't dare!"

He sighed and continued, "The situation outside, I wonder how the Great Daoist Master intends to handle it?"

"Isn't this all the great work of that good adopted son of yours!"

Longkang Yao swore, but a sudden ominous premonition arose in Fu He's heart. A chill crept over him as he realized this Daoist Master Lu was likely here to spoil things. Before he could say more, he saw Lu An step forward and say in a low voice,

"The dignity of Gu Prefecture is a great matter, but is Daoist Master Gu's life a small one? Since the mistake was made by my unworthy son, I, Lu, am willing to go out of the pass alone, to the west, and speak with that King Wei to do my utmost to preserve Daoist Master Gu's life..."

Longkang Yao didn't trust Fu He, but with the matter of Bian Fan before them, he didn't trust the Lu family now either. He remained silent, not speaking.

Fu He immediately said, "Great Daoist Master! This junior has already mentioned before that the current situation is due to someone with divine abilities secretly colluding with the outside... Even if the Great Daoist Master does not trust this junior, you cannot lightly trust others either!"

Lu An turned to look at him.

It was as if only at this moment did this Daoist Master Lu see the cultivator before him. He swept a faint glance over him and said,

"Such mighty airs. May I ask what crime the Lu family is guilty of?"

Fu He was inwardly alarmed, but his words did not retreat.

"Why does Daoist Master Lu confess without being accused? This junior acts with Gu Prefecture's best interests at heart. Who, then, does the Daoist Master act for?"

He wasn't sure if he would still be able to stand here and speak after Lu An's next words, so he quickly continued:

"This junior will not discuss other matters, but Li Zhouwei is determined to set foot on Chun City's soil. As long as this point stands, we have no room for negotiation. Even if we get Daoist Master Gu back, he would surely consider it a shame to survive by ceding territory!"

Lu An squinted at him but did not speak.

There was nothing wrong with Fu He's words, and it was also the point Lu An was most uncertain about—the Lu family certainly cared about their relationship with the Bright Yang, but they were unwilling to bear the infamy of being a mediators who ceded territory!

Longkang Yao remained silent, but Fu He racked his brains, his gaze fixed tightly on the horizon, watching the light of Converging Water that floated in the sky. He suddenly froze on the spot.

His action was quite obvious, causing Longkang Yao to also look up. He glanced at the Converging Water in the sky with a slight frown, only to hear Fu He say with a tremor in his voice.

"Great Daoist Master! Senior Gu... I fear... something has already... happened to him!"

His words were utterly fantastical, causing Longkang Yao's brow to furrow at once as he sneered.

"You seem to know more about his life and death than my Blazing Aridity Heaven!"

However, he also took another look at the Converging Water light in the sky, hesitant, but then heard Fu He bow and say:

"Great One, Li Zhouwei must be feigning weakness!"

His words were disjointed, but they struck at the Great Daoist Master's hidden worry. The reason Longkang Yao was hesitating and his expression was placid was precisely because he also suspected Li Zhouwei was bluffing him!

Longkang Yao said flatly, "Do you think I don't suspect it? But if we are both feigning weakness, can he truly suppress me?"

Fu He said sorrowfully, "Has the Great One ever considered... how can the mighty Converging Water be suppressed? And by whom?"

Longkang Yao glanced at him, the coldness in his expression slowly fading as he said, "It must be Yu Xixin!"

Fu He nodded gravely and said in a low voice, "When I came out, I received instructions from the Great One, who said that the Bright Yang's phenomenon is already established, and with secret methods, suppressing Gu You would not be difficult. Li Zhouwei must be feigning weakness! That is why this junior says... something has already happened to Daoist Master Gu!"

"His hasty return was to lure the Great Daoist Master into a trap. Even if the Great Daoist Master holds back, once the battle is at its fiercest, if Yu Xixin suddenly attacks with his full strength, he will surely be able to heavily injure the Great Daoist Master!"

Seeing him use his father as a guarantee, Longkang Yao opened his mouth, looked towards the sky, and said,

"If Gu You were dead, there would certainly be a response from the grotto-heaven, and the heavens and earth would surely change color. How could there be only this minor anomaly? It is merely Gu You struggling..."

Fu He said softly, "Exiled Qi. While Yang Ruiyi may not interfere, there is still Yang Ruizao. He himself is extremely close to the Li family and possesses that treasured cauldron. Would it not be simple to dissipate the unusual phenomena? It is just that he cannot eliminate the Great Daoist Master's own phenomenon all at once, so it must leak out repeatedly, making it look like a struggle!"

"And it is precisely the Exiled Qi that prevents the grotto-heaven from detecting his death!"

Lu An raised his eyebrows and said coldly, "Ridiculous! The King of Wei values talent..."

"Senior is mistaken!"

Fu He raised his head, his tone flat, "The Bright Yang's cruel and tyrannical nature is its true essence. Li Zhouwei values talent, but he values talent that can be used by him... If Daoist Master Gu could be used by him, he would already be standing outside the city. Senior Longkang will not stay outside for long and must eventually return to the grotto-heaven. How could he not take Daoist Master Gu with him? And how could Daoist Master Gu be the kind of talent he values?"

"The White Qilin is bloodthirsty and cruel. Would he not bear to execute a Great Daoist Master who cannot be of use to him, in order to perfect his own phenomenon? He wants to kill not only Daoist Master Gu, but also Senior Longkang! The Wei Emperor's act of removing crowns and clipping wings is a recent precedent; how can this not be considered!"
