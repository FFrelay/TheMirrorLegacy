# Chapter 1348: A Plan in Motion

His words were truly severe, and silence immediately fell upon the lakeside.

Emperor Wei's reputation was too great. His past tyranny was known throughout the world, and he even dared to drag secluded masters from the mountains to demand their fealty. Gu You was fundamentally the type who would rather die than yield, so in the presence of so many with divine abilities, should he offend in the slightest, how could Li Zhouwei possibly spare him?

Even Lu An dared not respond or make such a guarantee before Longkang Yao—the Lu family had always played both sides to avoid disaster, and who could possibly answer for a Bright Yang's temper?

A hush fell over them for a moment, while Longkang Yao gazed at the Converging Water in the sky, pondering the possibilities in the man's words as his expression grew ever darker.

As his mood shifted, waves of flame began to flicker between the Great Void and reality, yet he remained standing stubbornly, gazing at the colors in the sky.

Seeing that only one final push was needed, Fu He grew anxious and immediately looked to the Pang father and son beside him, giving them a subtle, meaningful glance.

The two had intended to remain aloof, but Pang Yi and Fu He were on good terms, so he ultimately could not refuse to speak. Seeing his friend's burning gaze, he had no choice but to reluctantly step forward and sigh.

"My only concern is for Senior Gu... I have already made one mistake; the Great Daoist Master absolutely must not make another..."

Gu You was the very issue constraining the Great Daoist Master at this moment. The words were ambiguous, leaving each to their own interpretation. Longkang Yao's eyelid twitched, a flicker of his emotional turmoil made plain, and he swept a gloomy glance over them, saying,

"It seems Daoist Master Pang recognizes his error... The two passes were lost and Gu You was captured; you share in that responsibility. Why don't you, fellow Daoist Pang, leave the city and ascertain the truth of the matter for me!"

Clearly, Longkang Yao was a Great Daoist Master, after all—not one to be incited by a few mere words. In that brief moment of astonishment, he had already grasped the crux of the issue.

'You claim Gu You is dead, so I'll just send someone to ask, and then I'll know, won't I? They can go straight into King Wei's camp and request an audience with Gu You. If Li Zhouwei intends to harm me, he will surely make all manner of excuses, but if he doesn't want a fight to the bitter end, what's the harm in seeing Gu You?'

And with the precedent set by Bian Fan, this person could of course not be Lu An, nor was it possible for Fu He to venture into such a dangerous place. The choice naturally fell to Pang Yi, who stood to the side, seemingly neutral all along!

Pang Yi was startled, but his face remained a mask of calm composure, showing no fear as he performed a deep bow.

"I have long been burdened by guilt and had precisely this intention—however, the Yu and Pang families are as close as flesh and blood. I must avoid any suspicion, so I ask that you choose someone else..."

He immediately added,

"Of course! Daoist Master Xixin's Dao-Profundity is exceedingly high; it's not impossible that he could falsify an aura. My father and he come from the same palace and are proficient in the Azure Profundity arts. I request that my father and I go together to assist in discerning the truth!"

It was a brilliant response, one step back and one step forward. Fu He understood his implication and immediately fell into a bow.

"My lord! King Wei's might is vast. If we casually send any divine ability user deep into his camp, they might be coerced by his Bright Yang divine ability upon seeing such overwhelming power. If they see through a trick, how could they possibly ruin King Wei's plans and cut off their own future prospects, even if they discovered a plot? This envoy... must be chosen with extreme caution!"

Longkang Yao's expression softened as he nodded, thinking to himself:

'True.'

If Li Zhouwei was scheming against him, the envoy would indeed have to be someone unafraid of a Bright Yang's might. With the supervision of the proficient Pang clan members, the matter would surely be secure!

'Unfortunately, returning to Blazing Aridity Heaven to summon a trusted subordinate... is surely out of the question now...'

Fu He immediately said, "Since Daoist Master Lu and fellow Daoist Pang are recusing themselves to avoid suspicion, I must naturally do the same. I have heard there is a cultivator in the Prefecture, a rogue cultivator by the name of Ye Tuji, who is said to be resolute, brave, sharp, and eloquent... When the Bright Yang forces invaded from the east, most of the rogue cultivators in the Prefecture fled, yet he alone remained calm and unhurried, continuing to read his scriptures within the Prefecture. Why not choose him!"

Longkang Yao, however, was in no rush. He turned to Lu An and said with a smile,

"Fellow Daoist Lu, have you heard of this person?"

Lu An was slightly taken aback, apparently not having expected Fu He to nominate someone other than one of his own confidants. And this person... Lu An happened to know him as well. He sighed.

"He is a brave man, and a good friend of my adopted son... He came to cultivate here on my son's recommendation."

"Excellent!"

Longkang Yao thought little of it, offered a word of praise, and immediately had the man summoned. Before long, a tall, slender man descended into the pavilion. He was indeed a man of fine bearing, causing everyone to spare him a few extra glances. Only Pang Yi looked away and fell silent.

With the Lu family's assurance, Longkang Yao's doubts were finally dispelled. He stated his intention, saying,

"Go and see for yourself. Report back with news, and I will take you away from your worldly karma and bring you to Blazing Aridity Heaven!"

The group dispersed. Pang Yi remained silent the entire time. As they left the lakeside, he looked at his father. Pang Queyun was also deep in silent thought. Pang Yi suppressed his divine ability, his expression plain, but he sneered inwardly:

'Fu He is too impatient! He's wasted such a good background, such a perfect opportunity to curry favor with those above. He doesn't know the first thing about deception, handling it all so crudely. If it had been left to me, with a scheme at the two passes, Gu You would be dead without a doubt, and Li Zhouwei and Longkang Yao would have started fighting long ago. What need would there be for all this back-and-forth testing?'

He sighed softly, his thoughts ultimately turning to his own family.

'But we are ultimately without backing, caught in the middle of this upheaval; extricating ourselves will not be easy!'

Pang Queyun glanced at Ye Tuji, who stood nearby with a composed demeanor, not having said a word, and replied in a low voice:

'Fortunately, your response was clever. But Fu He is iron-willed; you may have avoided him easily this once, but how many more times can you do so? Let us take it one step at a time... If the situation becomes critical, we should just let them offend someone ruthless. That way, we won't be so conspicuous caught in the middle.'

The son, with a smile on his face, replied inwardly:

'Just watch, Father. You can count the days and wait!'

......

The great hall was resplendent with light.

"Daoist Master Yu."

The golden-eyed man strode swiftly down from the dais. Looking at the approaching purple-robed Daoist Master, he hesitated for a moment.

"May I ask, Daoist Master, are there any cultivators in Gu Prefecture who practice in the mountains?"

Yu Xixin, taken aback, shook his head.

"With the orthodox lineages established now, people have long since lost the qualification to cultivate on the mountain. Those of us within the Prefecture have our own grotto-heavens and are a proud lot, for the most part; we don't like to associate with those inside."

Li Zhouwei frowned, and Li Ximing could not help but step forward to emphasize the point:

"Not a single one?"

Yu Xixin hesitated for a moment.

"If nominal disciples count... there should be one or two. The most recent... is from the Fu clan, by the name of Fu Tanjian... But he is not a significant figure. In those days, Tongxuan Palace's nominal disciples were all over the world; they are not qualified to inherit a Great Dao."

As soon as these words were spoken, the crimson-robed man standing to the side with his head bowed in silence lifted his head slightly, a flicker of inscrutable thought in his golden eyes.

Li Jiangqian had only just arrived and had already exchanged information with his father. What he heard had left him in a cold sweat. He appeared calm at this moment, but in reality, his heart was filled with ice as he secretly gritted his teeth:

'The Yang family... what a fine surprise. When Western Shu made its move, could you truly have been unaware!'

At this moment, he only regretted that his use of Yang Ruiyi had been too superficial, and he seethed with resentment. Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, noted the name down. Just as he was about to ask more, he heard the sound of hurried footsteps as Qiao Wenliu entered to pay his respects and reported in a low voice:

"Your Majesty! Longkang Yao has sent men!"

His words stunned everyone. A clamor arose outside as well; clearly, no one had expected someone as proud as Longkang Yao to send an envoy. Qiao Wenliu's face was full of pride, and Yu Xixin smiled while stroking his beard, the mood becoming relaxed.

Qiao Wenliu said with a laugh, "They sent three people, right up to the front of the pass. I thought they had sent some useless fools to provoke us, but who would have thought they came to make inquiries. King Wei has not seen them—everyone was shocked speechless."

Li Zhouwei's gaze, however, was grim. Li Jiangqian, who had just arrived, wore a slightly changed expression as he stepped forward and asked,

"Who are they?"

Qiao Wenliu said with a laugh, "Perhaps they were afraid we would kill their envoy without a second thought, so they sent a rogue cultivator named Ye Tuji. He has some fame, but he's no one important. He's merely accompanied by those two Pang family scoundrels, the father and son, and they are waiting before the hall!"

"The younger one is Pang Yi, the same man who was defending the two passes before. He must have abandoned Daoist Master Gu to save himself, offending Longkang Yao in the process, so he's come west with his worthless father to atone for his crimes!"

Li Zhouwei's voice was somber.

"What have they come for?"

Qiao Wenliu's voice steadied slightly.

"They wish to see Daoist Master Gu."

Li Zhouwei understood at once.

"Have them wait in a side hall—say that I have received an obituary and am currently paying my respects to the ancestors. Have them wait a moment, and then let Wu Miao enter from the side."

Though Qiao Wenliu was flamboyant, he was not foolish. On the contrary, this avaricious Daoist Master had survived until now precisely because he had used his wisdom to save himself on numerous occasions. He seemed to grasp something and hurried out.

The doors to the great hall closed and the formation activated. Li Jiangqian immediately dropped to his knees, his expression urgent as he spoke decisively,

"Father! Longkang Yao is suspicious!"

"He is..."

Li Zhouwei's expression flickered.

What else could it be for? His thoughts raced. He looked up, tapping the armrest with a hint of unease.

"I fear Longkang Yao saw the celestial phenomena and suspects something has happened to Gu You. To become suspicious over such a minor sign... he's being pushed to his limit. Whether he calls for intervention now rests on a single thought!"

Li Jiangqian gritted his teeth.

"And that thought will depend on Gu You!"

Li Ximing understood as well and said urgently, "Letting him go... would be the quickest solution, but I fear it is not wise..."

Li Zhouwei nodded grimly.

Immediately releasing Gu You would certainly resolve all doubts between the two sides, but it would also completely alter the current situation, and the future consequences would be unimaginable!

'The man's divine abilities are profound, and his Converging Water has that "Where Currents Return" art; his recovery speed is also extremely fast. Once he joins forces with Longkang Yao, I would have a hard time escaping their combined power!'

Although Li Zhouwei had captured Gu You quickly, it was only because neither knew the other's capabilities and his "Southern Emperor's Profound Grasp" had taken him by surprise. Gu You would have learned his lesson and would certainly not be so careless again. Add to that a prepared Longkang Yao... Yu Xixin was not skilled in combat; if a fight were to break out, the situation would deteriorate rapidly!

This would mean the end of the entire eastern campaign, forfeiting this excellent situation. He could forget about entering Chun City again anytime soon... he might even be counter-attacked during his retreat!

While retreating was the best course of action for the current situation, asking Li Zhouwei to give up everything he had gained without taking anything would be unacceptable not only to him, but likely also to the other cultivators with divine abilities.

"Could the Heavenly Nurture Urn... allow them a glimpse, just to put their minds at ease?"

"That is not difficult."

Li Zhouwei's voice was cold as he stared at the side door of the great hall.

"But if it were truly that simple, there would have been no need for the south to send us a warning!"

Even without Li Suining's reminder, Li Zhouwei absolutely understood the logic of using Gu You's life to placate Longkang Yao—the very fact that a message had arrived from the south meant there was something more to this matter!

Soon, there was a knock at the door. Wu Miao entered with a beaming face, but he immediately sensed the stagnant atmosphere in the great hall. Seeing the three Daoist Masters of the Li family standing on the dais with various expressions, he quickly stepped forward and fell to his knees with a thud.

"Greetings, my lords!"

Li Zhouwei said softly, "Wu Miao, in your younger years, you moved between the various families. Do you know... who this Ye Tuji is?"

Wu Miao paused, a troubled look on his face.

"Your Majesty, in these recent years, this subordinatehas only curried favour with those of the great houses of the Three Profundities; I have not set foot elsewhere. I have heard the name... only that he is a resolute and capable man... but I am not familiar with him..."

Li Zhouwei had no choice but to ask, "And which family is the Pang clan? What kind of people are that father and son?"

Wu Miao immediately brightened, speaking as if counting his family treasures.

"The Pang clan are descendants of the Azure Profundity, and their ancestors were close with the Yu family. They cultivated under Changtang before venturing out. They haven't been very famous in recent years, but this father and son pair are quite capable. They are well-connected in the Prefecture and have considerable means..."

Li Jiangqian took a step forward, not looking directly at the Daoist Master as he said coolly,

"What Daoist Master Wu dares not say, I will say for him. Pang Yi takes advantage of every situation to avoid harm, will not hesitate to kill wantonly, schemes for short-term gain at the cost of the future, and dares to abandon a critical, decisive position—he is nothing more than a petty villain."

Li Jiangqian had personally faced Pang Yi at the two passes. Although they had never met face-to-face or exchanged blows, from the shifting of the overall situation, the deployment of troops, and even the final act of abandoning the city and fleeing, Li Jiangqian had already drawn his conclusion!

Having said this, he turned and stared intently at Wu Miao.

"Is it true or not?"

Wu Miao was speechless. He moved his lips several times but, fearing the pressure from these great figures, dared not speak. Yet no one in the hall was willing to wait for him. Li Jiangqian shook his head.

"You are unwilling to offend them, and I do not need your judgment—I only ask you, how does Pang Queyun compare to his son?"

Wu Miao sighed.

"Like father, like son!"

The Pang father and son were thriving, but as they were all of the Purple Mansion Realm, how could Wu Miao's judgment be poor? This impartial sentence said everything that needed to be said.

"Good!"

Li Zhouwei nodded lightly, a plan already formed in his mind.

"You need only summon Ye Tuji. The others will wait."

"Yes!"

Wu Miao departed, looking somewhat panicked and hesitant. King Wei turned sideways, his gaze falling upon his second son, his eyes holding a deep meaning as he said only:

"Do not be stingy."

Their eyes met, and Li Jiangqian understood at once. A plan also formed in his own mind as he pondered his father's intentions and said,

"I request an audience with Daoist Master Yu."

"You may go see him yourself. Be quick about it."

A cold smile lit up in Li Jiangqian's slightly narrow eyes, making his already handsome face even more striking. He cupped his hands, turned, and departed, his heart clear.

'For great matters, these two must be used!'
