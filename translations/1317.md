# Chapter 1317: Celestial Phenomenon

As evening descended, mountain springs tinkled, and forests blazed with autumn color. Nestled among the encircling peaks lay a great city, ancient and unassuming in appearance yet refined in every detail. Spiritual qi gathered here in extraordinary density. Few figures moved through its streets—only the occasional elder hurrying past, their auras dim and inscrutable, clearly no ordinary mortals.

This was Chun City of Gu Prefecture.

Since ancient times, Gu Prefecture had been the center of the world. When the Immortal Dao flourished, this place distilled the essence of the entire realm. The outer ring contained one prefecture and twenty-one cities, boundaries drawn by Taishu Kuangyi in ages past. At the very center, seventeen mountains enclosed a great city that had once served as the Human Emperor's traveling palace!

Sadly, when Zixuan verified the Dao, he unleashed a storm of blood and carnage. That First Demon Ancestor slaughtered the great venerables, scattering the great families across the land and razing the palace itself. When the families finally returned, they rebuilt a smaller city on this site.

The cultivator who led them home bore the Daoist title Daochun, later becoming True Monarch Daochun of the Azure Profundity tradition. In gratitude for his immortal virtue and in reverence of his celestial majesty, the families named this place Chun City.

Each family possessed secret realms and grotto-heavens to shelter their people, permitting only those accomplished in cultivation to venture out to this place.

Thus within this small city, not a single person lacked profound cultivation. The ancient bluestone pavements were forged from Treasured Earth, the black roof tiles that appeared plain and unadorned were cast from dark gold, and everything from the fluttering banners in the streets to the trees in the mountain forests shimmered with a pristine, luminous glow.

Yet amid this harmony, a streak of light came rushing from the west in obvious haste. After circling the city once, it could only descend toward a nearby mountain, seeking out a small lake hidden deep within the layers of forest and heading for a pavilion by its shore.

Two men sat within the pavilion. The one on the left wore hemp robes and hunched forward, appearing quite elderly. The man on the right seemed younger, and they sat facing each other in quiet confrontation. Two more figures stood outside the pavilion—one with a fierce countenance, hands clasped behind his back, clearly agitated, while the other appeared quite young and relatively at ease.

When Jiang Dai descended, the first person stepped forward with grave eyes.

"So it truly is... King Wei?"

The fierce battle in the west and the multitude of divine abilities displayed—he must have seen it all. Jiang Dai simply said,

"Reporting to uncle.. it is indeed so..."

The man before him was none other than Jiang Fuwang!

This general of considerable talent wore an expression of deep concern, sensing the scent of danger. Just as he was about to inquire further, Jiang Dai's eyes were already filled with disbelief as he exclaimed in shock,

"He's a Great Daoist Master!"

This statement fell like a boulder into the lake. The previously calm atmosphere in the bright pavilion rippled with disturbance. One of the seated men dropped his game piece and sighed.

"In the end, Heavenly Glow proved superior in skill!"

His opponent did not respond, merely holding a piece in silence. Below, Jiang Fuwang froze for a moment before gritting his teeth.

"As I suspected! I wondered where that Imperial Observation of the Origin came from!"

Without the slightest hesitation, his sense of foreboding grew ever stronger. He demanded,

"Where's Qiao Sanyi?"

Jiang Dai's face also showed clear unease as he lowered his head.

"He was lured out by someone's spiritual fire... This junior originally intended to go rescue him, but was intercepted by that Li Jiangqian. Not long after, the divine mysteries of Imperial Observation of the Origin manifested... Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, I immediately withdrew."

Jiang Fuwang's expression darkened as he listened.

"Li Jiangqian? Your Subjugating Crest has already been perfected, yet he could actually block you?"

Jiang Dai could only lower his head.

"He possesses a treasure gourd that was quite formidable..."

But Jiang Fuwang had no time to hear his explanation. He paced rapidly back and forth beneath the pavilion with clasped hands.

"Qiao Sanyi has surrendered!"

Jiang Dai raised his head, hesitating to speak. The burly man before him gradually showed hatred on his face.

"This is troublesome indeed!"

"Back when Pang Ren proposed this underhanded strategy, I warned the old Daoist Master that it would surely leave future troubles. They suppressed the matter without addressing it, leaving Sanyi resentful. That would have been one thing, but they also marginalized him, sending him back to guard Juan City..."

He spoke urgently.

"He already harbored dissatisfaction with the prefecture. Now that he's submitted to Bright Yang, aside from our few families who treated him well in the past, who else would he show the slightest courtesy?"

"Brother Jiang speaks incorrectly."

The young man beside him interjected with a smile.

"The one surnamed Qiao has always been shameless and greedy. While in the city, he cursed this person and talked back to that one—nobody could stand him. Guarding Juan City was his own request, obviously to protect his clan and prepare to defect to Bright Yang. His heart had already turned—how could he be restrained?"

"Otherwise, considering how he always prided himself on superior cleverness, how could a mere spiritual fire lure him into a trap?"

Jiang Fuwang's words stuck in his throat. He shot the man a cold glance, cursing inwardly,

'Couldn't you Pang Yi have assigned someone else to guard it and kept him in the prefecture? Once Juan City was lost, wouldn't that have been the perfect opportunity to send him to reclaim it? For the sake of his own foundation, how could he not have given his utmost?'

But such words belonged to the art of war, not the way of treating people. Jiang Fuwang had ties with the Qiao family and would not speak such things to offend anyone, so he merely turned silently away.

Only then did the young man turn toward those above, smiling,

"Two Lords, though Juan City serves as a gateway, beyond it lie the two passes of Yun and Pu. There's no need for excessive worry. Simply block him outside the passes, deploy forces to the north to prevent him from circling around, and withdraw people east of Wei Prefecture. If he circles eastward and wishes to avoid conflict with Yan Kingdom, we'll force him to border Yan directly. When that happens, can the Compassion Dao simply stand by and watch?"

Pang Yi stated flatly.

"Li Zhouwei's swift capture of Juan City appears to catch us off guard, but in truth he has led his army into dangerous territory without realizing it."

Though Jiang Fuwang disliked how he abandoned Qiao Wenliu like worn shoes, he had to admit the strategy was quite sound. He fell silent for a moment, then saw the old man wave dismissively,

"You may withdraw."

Pang Yi's expression remained unchanged as he bowed and departed. Jiang Dai glanced at his uncle and withdrew as well, leaving only three people by the lake. Jiang Fuwang heard the old man say,

"Fuwang, what if we sent Pang Yi westward to resist King Wei?"

Jiang Fuwang performed a bow. Despite his dislike for the man from moments ago, he still replied,

"Daoist Master Pang is resourceful, but values private interests over public duty. If you must send him, you'll need to carefully consider who accompanies him..."

The old man then asked,

"How does he compare to Qi Lanyan?"

Jiang Fuwang fell silent for a long time before answering:

"Resourceful but lacking in courage. Moreover, the Qi Lanyan of those days could at least withstand King Wei in combat of divine abilities... But fellow Daoist Pang..."

He paused briefly, then stated bluntly.

"Today's King Wei... even if Qi Lanyan were resurrected, with just those three Horn Wood abilities, he could barely stand firm before him. How much less fellow Daoist Pang?"

The old man laughed,

"Since he's insufficient, and King Wei has grown even more formidable than before, how could he possibly block him? If you say we need someone who can actually stop him, then we must send a Great Daoist Master."

Jiang Fuwang nodded solemnly.

The old man asked,

"Which fellow Daoist is currently in the city?"

Jiang Fuwang seemed to have already considered this in his brief contemplation. He said softly,

"Senior Shangguan is cultivating at the mountain's base, searching for that Revering Radiance Moon Vein. Daoist Master Tang has also gone out, traveling to the Eastern Sea. And then... there's also Daoist Master Gu, who still has some leisure time, cultivating within the Wenhuang Residence..."

The old man chuckled deeply,

"Then let it be Gu You. What do you think?"

Those final two words were directed not at the junior below, but at the man seated across the game board who had remained silent throughout, holding a white piece and listening quietly.

This man appeared middle-aged with sword-like brows and starry eyes, a broad face and thick shoulders. His Daoist robe alternated between yellow and white. His pale, thick hands gripped the white piece. Only upon hearing the question did he raise his head.

In that instant, a hazy yellow light descended and enveloped the small pavilion. Whether the Great Void or the mortal world, everything seemed to split apart in a single moment. He smiled,

"However Senior Qu wishes to arrange matters is the senior's affair. No need to ask Guanyi."

The old man shook his head with a laugh,

"How could I not ask?"

"Guanyi's visit this time is not for Bright Yang's affairs. In truth, I've come from near the Great Tomb River to take position by the river, requesting that Senior Qu join me in suppressing a certain location."

"Oh? What location?"

"Juan City."

The smile on the old man's face finally froze, his gaze gaining several degrees of caution. He said softly,

"What instructions might there be?"

Yao Guanyi raised his head and remarked casually,

"The old Daoist Master may not know—some days ago, great waves arose on the Converging Heaven Sea. Several Dragon Princes and dragon descendants rode their mounts into the inner sea, crossing the waters and traveling westward along the river channels. They reached Qi territory a few days past, and counting the days, they'll arrive from the west very soon!"

Old Daoist Master Qu started in alarm, "Is it for the Great Tomb incident?!"

"No."

Yao Guanyi's smile held inscrutable meaning.

"They've come to see him."

Old Daoist Master Qu first froze, then quickly realized who was in Juan City. Finally, he pondered deeply.

Yao Guanyi state mildly, "Senior Qu, Beijia's official jurisdiction lies within the Ji River. If He assumes the primary position, the Great River would usurp Ji. Now only a single tributary of Ji River remains beneath, which is still forced to empty into the Grand River. In fact, it's not just Ji River—the Great River itself is also His domain to traverse, only He dares not come."

Receiving his reminder, Daoist Master Qu took a long while before saying,

"Though Beijia's jurisdiction indeed lies in Ji River, he can certainly follow the waterways into the mainland. In the past, Dongfang Tianye and Dongfang Zaishi both vied for supremacy and traveled the waters this way—but ordinarily they would never come. This time they're... going to..."

"Now that he's dispatched several Dragon Princes and descendants, naturally they must meet the qilin, and only dare do so at Ji River."

Yao Guanyi's words were clear, causing Old Daoist Master Qu to fall silent for a moment before saying,

"The Hornless Dragon lineage entering the mainland is no small matter. No wonder you must oversee it personally."

"Ah."

Yao Guanyi shook his head.

"It's actually just a trifling matter. Not conducting it in the Eastern Sea but instead under the very nose on my mountain—it's merely a test. I've thought it over. This ultimately concerns affairs below the mountain and involves Bright Yang. I've already interfered quite enough from start to finish. If I act now, who knows whether it might displease those in Dongmu Heaven."

"Considering this takes place in Juan City, the former practice ground of the True Monarch of Treasured Earth, I thought of the Numinous Treasure Order—originally, I should have sought Martial Uncle Wang Ziya."

He paused for an instant, a trace of regret floating through his eyes.

"But unfortunately, Martial Uncle Wang returned to the grotto-heaven years ago, bringing that great personage a complete Crystalline Jade Branch for observing transformation, allowing that great one to contemplate it. So the grotto-heaven has been sealed these past years with no word at all. Thus I must trouble you, old Daoist Master, to act."

Before Old Daoist Master Qu could speak, he saw Yao Guanyi bow formally into the void and retrieve a scroll from the Great Void, holding it reverently in his hands.

This so frightened the old man that his calm expression shattered instantly.

Just like the Great Daoist Master of the Tuoba family in years past, he leaped up and fell to his knees, both shocked and terrified.

"How can this be! How can this be!"

Yao Guanyi showed no surprise, only laughing helplessly,

"Old Daoist Master misunderstands!"

He helped the old man up and placed the scroll in his hands with both of his own, telling him to open it and look. The old man, still shaken, unrolled it.

He saw depicted upon the scroll a wondrous scene: immortal mountains floating ethereally into the clouds, below them a towering pavilion covered in countless patterns, immortals coming and going—the ultimate expression of profound mysteries. This single glance plunged the old man into infinite contemplation. His Dao-Profundity, stagnant for who knows how many years, immediately experienced a sudden enlightenment!

He could hardly tear his eyes away, slowly looking downward to discover an inscription at the bottom:

**[Qu Tianxiang of Tongxuan Palace, presented to Brother Yu]**

In that instant, intense Treasured Earth radiance surged skyward, as if to connect with that Fruition Attainment of Treasured Earth in the unseen world between heaven and earth, bringing down all manner of divine wonders—making iron and stone bloom, profound earth generate life, fertile soil stretch ten thousand li, and all treasures conceal themselves!

Old Daoist Master Qu had just stood up when his knees weakened and he fell to the ground again with a thud. His lips trembled as he stared for a long time, unable to speak a single word. After an unknown interval, he finally exclaimed with mingled joy and awe,

"This is actually the Ancestral Master's own hand!"

This object was none other than a personal work by that True Monarch of Nurturing Life and Prosperous Treasures, Xu Xiang!

The two men performed ritual obeisance and burned incense before completing the exchange. The old man received this treasure, cradling it between both hands with reverence and delight.

Yao Guanyi smiled, "My great lord has long thought that the high position of Treasured Earth has remained vacant for too long, its inheritance gradually thinning. Though this perfectly accords with our Tongxuan principles, we conversely lack any proper mortal Daoist tradition, allowing those nine-stream charlatans of Outside the Profound to impersonate us. Thus displeasure arose—he specially asked me to retrieve this item and present it to Senior Qu!"

He did not specify which nine-stream charlatan of Outside the Profound, yet this made Old Daoist Master Qu nod repeatedly, as if he'd long harbored such complaints. Yao Guanyi observed the other's involuntary expression and stated solemnly,

"With this single object, your Dao in this lifetime can be fulfilled. Moreover, this represents the most orthodox Treasured Earth tradition in the mortal realm. You can use it to establish a sect, leave behind a inheritance, and continue your predecessor's legacy... No need to... depend on others..."

Each of Yao Guanyi's words struck the old man's heart. Tears streamed down his face as he nodded repeatedly. Unable to bow while holding the treasure, he could only say,

"Many thanks, fellow Daoist, and please convey my gratitude to the great lord as well!"

Yao Guanyi nodded with a smile. Old Daoist Master Qu paused, finally steeling his resolve.

"If I may ask, regarding Ji River... are there any particular instructions?"

The expression in Yao Guanyi's eyes finally grew distant. He said softly,

"Naturally, it's official business."

He stated mildly.

"Though the Dragon-kin dwell overseas, they still dare not raise their voices above the waters before the world. How much less so on the mainland? After the Great Tomb battle, all under heaven were shocked. The Dragon-kin's attitude will certainly undergo great change. If negotiations with the qilin break down, your presence there, Senior, represents a position."

Yao Guanyi's eyes gradually turned cold. Not knowing what came to mind, he seemed to gain several degrees of killing intent.

"Furthermore... Guanyi also wishes to hear what promises the Hornless Dragon lineage makes, and how our white qilin..."

His tone floated lightly,

"Responds in turn."
