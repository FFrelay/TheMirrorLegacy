# Chapter 1201: A Swift Decision

After consulting with his elders, Li Jiangqian retrieved the spiritual items and returned all the way to the mountains, where he began pondering the wording of his reply to Liu Changdie; at the same time, he lowered his brow in concentration, as Gongsun Bofan had already arrived.

This Guest Retainer had just returned from Jianghuai looking weary from his travels; he was getting on in years, and Guest Retainers like him had no opportunity to seek the Dao for divine abilities, so he had settled his ambitions and focused his thoughts on his descendants, which put Li Jiangqian greatly at ease.

He was also a surrendered subordinate whom Li Zhouwei had taken in; back in his days with the Capital Immortals Dao, he had frequently clashed with the south and offended many people, making him something of a 'lone courtier,' so he paid his respects in the mountain and listened as the Daoist Master above spoke casually:

"How did Situ Huo reply?"

Gongsun Bofan lowered his head slightly and said respectfully,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, Daoist Master Situ... is in seclusion in the mountains."

"Seclusion?"

Li Jiangqian frowned, his gaze darkening, and said:

"A letter arrived from him just a few days ago; how could he suddenly be in seclusion today."

Seclusion for cultivation was not uncommon in the Purple Mansion Realm, but Situ Huo had clearly emerged from his last seclusion just one year ago!

'His last seclusion was explicitly to condense a divine ability; there was no news of any major disturbance, so I don't know if he succeeded... But whether he succeeded or failed, it makes no sense for him to enter seclusion again after such a short time...'

Situ Huo did not refine pills or artifacts, and had only just emerged from seclusion related to a divine ability; Li Jiangqian immediately grew suspicious and asked,

"Is it truly seclusion? Who gave you this answer?"

Gongsun Bofan looked up and said,

"It was a junior cultivator from the Situ family named Situ Xu; with the Situ bloodlines severed, this man was not originally part of the family but changed his surname later, claiming to be a relative of Daoist Master Situ... He said there was no response from the cave dwelling."

Li Jiangqian set down his brush and, while inspecting his own letter, frowned and said,

"Oh?"

'Was this intentional... or a coincidence?'

Li Jiangqian was naturally suspicious; he was in a hurry to handle the Spiritual Artifacts with Situ Huo, so for the man to suddenly disappear inevitably made him wary, and he shook his head, musing inwardly,

'Situ Huo has already attained the Holder of the Profound and is an outstanding figure among those with three divine abilities; whether he is truly in seclusion or has secretly gone somewhere... this is not a good sign...'

With too little information, Li Jiangqian could not discern the truth, and since Situ Huo was not present, he had no way to force his return; he thus stood up, ordered someone to deliver the letter to the Eastern Sea, and turned his thoughts elsewhere:

'Besides Situ Huo, the only other Metal Virtue cultivator of note in the Purple Mansion Realm in Jianghuai is that Daoist Master Changyun...'

In truth, Li Jiangqian had not overlooked Changyun, but this Daoist Master Changyun was simply not a good choice—the man concealed his true capabilities, seemed to have innumerable ties to the Golden Feather, and possessed many resources, none inferior to those of the Li family...

'He truly might not even deign to look at these two Spiritual Artifacts from the Helian family! I can only try Zhong Qian...'

He sighed and started with Zhong Qian, sending a letter to the Revering Radiance Gate; he also sent inquiries one by one to others like Daoist Master Cheng Qian and Lingu Lanying—figures who might lack Spiritual Artifacts but had received a share of spiritual items from the great war—musing inwardly,

'I heard Old Daoist Master Xianyao's injuries are extremely severe, but because of his muddled divine abilities, he's just hanging on, half-dead; I wonder if he has finally fallen... Logically speaking, Cheng Qian is skilled in mercury arts, so keeping him alive for a few more years shouldn't be a problem...'

He did not care about Xianyao's injuries, but if Xianyao were to fall, Great Song and Yang Ruiyi would owe Cheng Qian compensation, and the man would naturally be motivated to trade for a Spiritual Artifact to protect his own life...

'Furthermore, if Great Song gives Cheng Qian a Whole Pill, it would be best to trade for it back on Quewan's behalf.'

He immediately focused on this and stressed, "You are to make a trip to Ridge-crossing Peak and inquire with Daoist Master Cheng Qian... Say that Daoist Master Zhaojing is concerned about his elder's injuries and wishes for me to pay a visit."

Gongsun Bofan nodded gravely, acknowledged the order, and retreated; only then did Li Jiangqian turn to sit down, examining the jade slips on his desk one by one, and after waiting a while, he saw Li Suihuan ascending the mountain and said with a smile,

"I'm sorry to trouble you with running back and forth, Suihuan."

This good nephew shook his head, bowed, and replied,

"Uncle, you are too kind!"

Li Jiangqian said no more, handing over the diagram for the formation foundation as he asked,

"How long will it take? How much trouble will it be? Are there any gaps in spiritual resources?"

Li Suihuan accepted the thick file, read it through carefully, and replied,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, spiritual resources are not a concern; with our family's reserves, forging this formation foundation will at most consume two or three-tenths of them; furthermore, Jianghuai has only just been reclaimed, and in this vast territory, only our family's markets and spirit fields remain intact; both the north and the east must come to us for provisions, so our current annual income is triple what it used to be; before the other major families in Jianghuai recover their strength... it is more than enough for our family to eat its fill."

"As for this formation... it has twelve foundation pillars; six are in the desert, which are easy to handle, but the other six are in the Western Mountains, which must be driven deep into the range... If I were to personally oversee this matter, I am afraid it would require three to five years."

This speed was already terrifyingly fast; the Li family was famous for its large number of low-level cultivators and held a great advantage in such matters; the speed at which the Vast Valley Profound Nails were forged back then was astonishing, and had it been any other family, it would have been impossible to complete in less than a dozen years.

But Li Jiangqian was not satisfied.

"Too slow."

Seeing the Daoist Master frown and shake his head, Li Suihuan paused, understood his meaning, and said,

"I was taking into account that Jianghuai is currently in ruins, and the prices for all types of spiritual resources are inflated... If we disregard that cost, the time can be shortened somewhat; if Uncle needs it faster still... we could halt work on every peak and have even the Qi Refining disciples cross the mountains; perhaps then it could be compressed to within two years... It is just..." Li Suihuan said solemnly, "It will exhaust the people and drain our coffers."

Li Jiangqian finally showed a hint of satisfaction, raising an eyebrow as he said,

"Exhausting the people is no matter; we can simply subsidize them with more resources and promote more of them; as long as the compensation is sufficient, it all comes down to a matter of wealth; this 'draining our coffers'... how much will it cost?"

The young man before him understood his meaning, calculated on his fingers, and replied,

"Following your method, Uncle, I am afraid the cost will climb to about three or four-tenths of our reserves."

After all, the even more troublesome task of establishing the Secret Realm still lay ahead, so saving every bit possible was a good thing; Li Jiangqian frowned and murmured,

"The consumption is truly enormous..."

Seeing him deep in thought, Li Suihuan said in a low voice,

"Our family has enough people; what we lack is the core strength in the Hundred Arts of Cultivation; fortunately, Suining's mastery of the Dao of formations is astounding; if he oversees it, and we can find ten, twenty, or even more formation specialists for him to command, it should be highly effective."

"Li Suining."

Li Jiangqian finally recalled the name, having a vague impression of it; he nodded and said,

"I did hear his talent for the Dao of formations was astounding, even alarming Grand-Uncle back then; since that is the case, I will take this opportunity to borrow some people from the Purple Smoke Gate..."

He paused, then said faintly,

"Saving resources is good, of course, but if we cannot, so be it; I do not care if it exhausts the people and drains our coffers; regardless of the cost, we must establish the formation foundation within two years... If we fail, it will no longer be a mere matter of exhausting people and draining our coffers!"

A Purple Mansion Realm grand formation was, of course, intended to defend against enemies—that much was obvious; Li Suihuan already understood this and retreated with utmost gravity.

He walked in pensive silence, his brow tightly furrowed, all the way to the lake shore, just as he saw a young man arriving, riding on lightning; Li Suihuan immediately composed his expression and said formally,

"Brother, your timing is perfect; I was just about to look for you!"

Li Suining was living his third life; the spell arts he needed to master had long since been completed, and his cultivation in the Dao of formations was profound, lacking only the assistance of a Purple Mansion Realm position; these past few days, he had been redrafting the secret method for the Secret Realm while keeping an eye on family matters, and as soon as he heard Li Suihuan had been summoned to the mountain, he immediately came looking.

The two brothers proceeded to the center of the island, sat down within the palace, and poured clear tea; Li Suihuan then passed the formation foundation diagrams over, saying,

"Take a look at this."

Li Suining was puzzled, but he accepted the thick, heavy stack; after just a cursory glance, he became completely engrossed, and only when he had finished the very last line did he exclaim in praise,

"Incredible!"

'There's no need to even think about it; such ingenious and original work must be the doing of Daoist Master Yuanbian!'

But his amazement quickly gave way to contemplation.

'It's not the Heavenly Desert Flame-Departure Spirit Formation, but the Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation... It really is different; sigh... I had thought I could use my past life's experience to build the foundation faster...'

In his past life, Qi Lanyan had not died, and his family's King Wei had not suffered such grievous injuries; however, when comparing the rewards, Li Suining was almost certain that despite it being the same battle of White sea, their current gains far exceeded those of his previous life!

'To say nothing of the spoils from Helian Wujiang himself, even the rewards from Great Song are grander than in my past life; the Lesser Yang spiritual item must have come from this.'

Without a doubt, the Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation was several levels higher in both brilliance and ingenuity, which was ultimately a good thing; yet, as Li Suining finished reading, a sudden, ominous premonition rose in his heart.

'But now... King Wei is injured.'

His gaze gradually grew solemn.

'Qing Jifang absolutely intends to put constraints on the lake; or rather, Western Shu is unwilling to lose Moongaze Lake as a bargaining chip to threaten Great Song; in my second life, it was King Wei who repelled Qing Jifang... Now, who will step forward?'

This realization brought a change to Li Suining's emotions; he remained silent for a long time, and Li Suihuan, sitting opposite him, also did not speak, merely leaning against the table and sipping his tea, his gaze fixed on the moonlight outside the window.

'Situ Huo? Changyun? Or Yehui?'

After an unknown amount of time, Li Suining raised his gaze, only to find that his fourth brother had at some point turned his head and was quietly watching him; he said,

"Brother, you are also worried about Western Shu."

Li Suining opened his mouth but was momentarily speechless, only to see Li Suihuan say softly,

"That isn't hard to guess." He stood up and continued, "If not for this, I would not have wished to disturb you, Brother; the matter in the great desert cannot be delayed for even a moment; the Daoist Master has given a deadline of two years; if the grand formation can be established, both the people and the formation will survive; if we are too late, I fear the formation will be destroyed and its people will perish—Brother, how confident are you?"

When Li Suining heard this, the giant boulder in his heart finally crashed to the ground, and he instantly let out a sigh of relief.

'As expected! Even without a reminder from someone like me, who has lived through two lives, Daoist Master Changli also predicted that Western Shu would definitely attack... It's good that they know...'

As long as Li Jiangqian was aware of this danger, the risk dropped by nearly seventy percent; Li Suining, of course, understood what the most useful thing for him to do right now was—as a cultivator who had once possessed a Purple Mansion Realm position, for him to personally manage this matter was almost equivalent to a Purple Mansion Realm formation master condescending to guide every detail!

He simply said with solemnity, "Just leave this matter to me!"

...

Command after command issued from the palace; overnight, the political hub of Moongaze Lake began to operate at high speed; Li Jiangqian likewise did not hesitate in the slightest, and just after instructing his nephew, he immediately stepped into the Great Void, his form appearing within the Purple and Gold Inner Formation above the lake.

Within the grand hall, the purple-gold light was somewhat dim, but below the profound steps, a white jade pool had been added; the water within it gleamed a shimmering white, with silvery flecks of mercury water floating on its surface, as multicolored light shone from within and spiritual energy surged forth.

A middle-aged man in black robes sat cross-legged within it, his features sinister, fierce, and venomous; his cheeks, however, were covered in dense, crimson-silver profound patterns, which roiled continuously like living things and radiated a dim, crimson light.

His aura fluctuated erratically, vaguely giving the sense of seeing through the mortal world and ascending to the Great Void, yet he hovered at the threshold of the Foundation Establishment Realm; his cultivation base was condensed to an extreme, supported by some invisible force that continuously lifted him upward.

It was precisely Li Wushao!

Li Jiangqian swept his gaze over him with a hint of amazement, but his eyes quickly moved past, landing on the main seat further back, where the woman with the vermilion dot between her brows sat in deep meditation, her hands forming seals as she cultivated.

Li Quewan had refined the 'Edict-God' aspect of the Profound Heng Edict Pill, nurturing it within her divine ability for over half a year, and then built this pool for Li Wushao to cultivate in; although she could spare some attention for other matters, she still needed to watch over this Spiritual Treasure, so she had not entered the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, remaining here to cultivate instead.

Seeing him enter, the woman opened her bright eyes; although her brother appeared quite calm, she could still perceive his somber mood, and just as she expected, she heard Li Jiangqian sigh and say,

"Situ Huo has disappeared."

Li Quewan fell silent for a moment before asking,

"Brother, do you mean... someone is plotting against us?"

"Not necessarily, but it hits us precisely at our most awkward point."

Li Jiangqian paced twice with his hands behind his back, glancing at Li WWushao soaking in the Mansion Water before asking,

"How much longer?"

Li Quewan shook her head with decisive regret, saying,

"This isn't a matter of a year or two; the original records stated it would require at least thirty years; our family's Supreme Yin spiritual essence is precious, and Awaiting the Supreme Divine possesses the power to bless and transform, but it still requires at least eight or nine years; for the first three years, neither I nor the Spiritual Treasure can leave; after three years, I can depart temporarily; at the six-year mark, he will finish consuming the spiritual essence and enter the Spiritual Treasure, at which point I will be free; after another three years, it will be complete."

Li Jiangqian was both joyful and worried to hear this, and he said,

"So you truly cannot be moved... Fortunately, the total time isn't that long, and more than a year has already passed; by that count, it will be over quickly, it's just..."

Seeing the woman look over in confusion, he said with a grim expression:

"In my view, we absolutely cannot take a long time to collect the spiritual items, yet Situ Huo has failed us at this critical juncture; regardless of whether any news comes from Jianghuai, we cannot simply wait."

"Fortunately, you handled the Nine Mounds perfectly and did not agree immediately; we still have room to maneuver!"

Li Quewan understood at once, frowning slightly as she said,

"Brother, are you referring to... the Nine Mounds' spirit fire, the Mountain-Levelling Radiant Fire..."

Li Ximing's original intention for this Radiant Fire was to use it to aid his cultivation, but then he ended up losing a True Fire; Li Quewan had taken this to heart, wanting to replace it for him, so how could Li Jiangqian not understand? He said gravely:

"This matter allows absolutely no delay; once we overcome this calamity, if we don't have a suitable True Fire to replenish Grand-Uncle, we can simply refine my Vast Desert Li Flame for him!"

Although her brother was a schemer, he was never ambiguous about major priorities; Li Quewan was also sharp as ice, understanding immediately, and said,

"In that case, I will send the selected materials for the formation plate to the Nine Mounds and offer them in exchange for that Radiant Fire; their family has just produced a new Daoist Master, so traveling to Jiangnan will be convenient for them!"
