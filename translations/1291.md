# Chapter 1291: Wei Prefecture

The smile lingered on the corner of his mouth, filled with deep meaning, yet it vanished in a mere instant; the two Great Daoist Masters seemed unaware of that momentary stagnation, conscious only of the indistinct clash of their divine abilities.

"Senior Xiao!"

This green-eyed Daoist Master, his face full of smiles, gazed at him for a long moment before speaking.

"In that case, it is undoubtedly about Fruition Attainment?"

Xiao Chuting exhaled and said playfully,

"If I am to test my Dao-work, 'Lord of Pit Water' at least sounds more pleasant."

Chi Buzi shook his head dismissively and said,

"I, however, lack Senior Xiao's confidence. Whether it's a Surplus Position or an Intercalary Position, it matters little; as long as the position is suitable, one has ultimately ascended. As the saying goes—'Gonghua cultivated early but settled for a Surplus Position; Loutai verified late and lost the Dao-fruit.' But as long as the situation and the position are correct, whether a step early or a step late, a day will eventually come when one can look down upon all under heaven."

The old man chuckled, shook his head, and replied,

"In the current Pit Water, Fruition Attainment is the true path forward."

His gaze was bright and held not a trace of hesitation. Chi Buzi immediately came to a realization, and looking at him with a smile, he asked,

"Senior, are you aware of... the opponents at the Great Tomb River?"

Xiao Chuting replied placidly,

"I have heard rumors."

Chi Buzi clasped his hands behind his back, walked forward, and began to explain,

"In recent years, I have been in seclusion cultivating along the coast of the Yan State, handling some troublesome affairs on the side, and I've gathered a piece or two of news. The Way of Compassion has already made its move, and that Great Daoist Master of Valley Water from the Murong family has also headed south..."

The old man nodded and said,

"I know of him. There is a Valley Water Spiritual Treasure within the Great Tomb River; apart from the World's Navel, I fear it cannot be found anywhere else. As for the Way of Compassion..."

He continued,

"The Dragon-kin and their people have contended for Yin alley for many years. With your intervention these past few years, their momentum has gradually faded. The dust must have settled. Since you were able to extricate yourself and come, they naturally will as well."

Chi Buzi nodded and said,

"People have already come from the Chen State in the Long region. As for the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the various houses from the Jin region, this junior need not elaborate. I heard that the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's unique Kongshu, the 'Liangli Unanswered by the Altar,' is preparing to make a move, to the extent that even the long-unseen Way of Precepts has appeared."

He chuckled and said,

"I know Senior's Dao-Profundity is immense, but these individuals cannot be underestimated. Even if that General Yang enters the Great Tomb River, he is not guaranteed to stand on your side!"

Xiao Chuting shook his head and said, "There are more! Mount Changhuai and the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition are also involved!"

The moment this was said, the atmosphere froze. Every faction the two Great Daoist Masters had listed was a paramount Immortal or Buddhist power of the current age, a great Daoist tradition that held dominion over its own region. For all of them to enter together was enough to stir the winds and clouds of the entire world!

Chi Buzi asked, "Does Senior have any certainty of success?"

Xiao Chuting, however, simply shook his head and stated frankly, "It depends on whether Daoist Master Xue decides to come."

Upon hearing this name, Chi Buzi's perpetually nonchalant expression finally shifted. The emotion in his pupils turned gradually sinister and cold as he said,

"I know of him."

"I heard that old Daoist Master Lou Xing, having surpassed the Purple Mystery, wielded his Sword Intent to battle him, yet did not last a hundred moves."

Lou Xing had a resolute temperament, and his reputation in Jiangnan back in the day was not stellar, but in matters of combat, no one dared underestimate him. In those years, when they had all just attained their divine abilities, the two Daoist Masters from the Purple Smoke Gate combined were still no match for him!

Yet, hearing this, Xiao Chuting shook his head and replied,

"He held back."

Chi Buzi narrowed his eyes slightly, their color turning dangerous with surprise, while the old man said calmly,

"I have been to the North Ring Sect. Fellow Daoist Zhensu mentioned it. He said... as long as that Xueyang wishes it, all cultivators in this realm beneath Golden Core must fight him bare-handed. Senior Lou Xing was aware of this, which is why he only brought a single sword."

"And Daoist Master Xue, having a friendly relationship with him, did not interfere with his ability to draw his sword."

Chi Buzi asked in a low voice, "Even Sword Intent cannot stop him?"

"It will be affected." The old man said faintly, "Senior Lou Xing only possessed Sword Intent; he did not cultivate a Way of the Sword divine ability. I fear that only if that young Fellow Daoist Wang from back then successfully cultivated Nurturing the Azure Heaven would he be qualified to draw his sword unhindered in Xueyang's presence."

"And even then, it would only be _using_ the sword."

Chi Buzi had never underestimated Mount Luoxia, but now he truly felt a headache coming on. He shook his head, understanding there was no point in discussing Xueyang any further. This direct disciple of Mount Luoxia was as tyrannical among those with divine abilities as Mount Luoxia was among the world's Daoist traditions. If he appeared, all other considerations would be meaningless.

He stated simply, "The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is in my hands."

The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal!

Xiao Chuting, of course, knew how powerful that item was. Back then, Ning Tiaoxiao, holding the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, was able to run rampant beneath the Purple Mystery realm despite having only a single divine ability; how much more so now that it was in Chi Buzi's hands!

At this declaration, Xiao Chuting raised his head slightly and said,

"I do not need you to achieve victory, Fellow Daoist, only to tie them down."

That pair of jade-green eyes shifted faintly as he added, "Two or three of them."

'Two or three...'

Xiao Chuting stroked his beard, gazing at him without a word for a long time. Only after an unknown while did he hear the younger man ask faintly,

"Dao Lord Wei... will he be coming?"

'Wei Xuanyin.'

If one were to ask which Daoist Master currently embroiled in this grand affair Chi Buzi dreaded most, it was, without a doubt, the lord of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao—Wei Xuanyin!

Xiao Chuting frowned and said,

"I have met him..."

He, Xiao Chuting, had been present at the great battle fought by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in Xiang Township, near Luoxia, all those years ago; he had even personally intervened to obstruct Wei Xuanyin.

Chi Buzi, however, said in a low voice,

"This man achieved four divine abilities long ago, each one a supreme inheritance of the Guanhua Daoist tradition. Currently, his Veiled Yin is unstable, having been wounded by Bright Yang, which is why he seems less terrifying... Most importantly... he has been in seclusion for many years. If he completes that final Robe of Concealed Flaws, his Veiled Yin will reach perfection, and things will be vastly different. The four divine abilities he previously mastered will all benefit, compensating for their deficiencies. Some of those ancient traditional divine abilities might even advance a step, emulating the phenomena of the ancient Veiled Yin..."

Chi Buzi's eyes flashed with a gloomy light.

"That King Wei will also be coming... That being the case, it is difficult to predict what changes will occur."

A thoughtful expression appeared on Xiao Chuting's face. Although he was rather confident, the situation was chaotic, and having to face a Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao Lord whose divine abilities were perfected was no simple matter.

"He is also a problem."

He did not elaborate, asking only, "What do you need, Fellow Daoist Chi?"

Chi Buzi smiled, a strange light in his eyes, and said pointedly,

"I am currently moving about in the sea, yet Senior asks what I need? Rather than what I need, it is what my lord needs—he needs Senior to succeed in verifying the Dao. That is why I am here to help you!"

Xiao Chuting smiled but said nothing, staring straight at him. Chi Buzi took two steps, then finally nodded and said,

"If Senior is amenable, then within the Great Tomb River, any items related to Mansion Water and Pristine Water, as well as any methods pertinent to my own attainment, shall naturally belong to me, Chi Buzi. Beyond that... simply being able to witness Senior Xiao completely verifying the Dao is, in itself, an incredibly rare and great fortuitous encounter!"

Xiao Chuting chuckled, shook his head, and said,

"If you hadn't asked for anything, I would not have dared to trust you."

Chi Buzi gazed at him for a long moment, then smiled and shook his head. He offered a cupped-fist salute, finally turned, and began to walk away, treading upon the pitch-black marsh waters. After several steps, he paused, tilted his head slightly, and said with a raised brow,

"If Senior succeeds, then one day... one day, when this Chi attempts to verify the Dao, I must ask Daoist Master Xiao to intervene. I only hope that when that time comes, you will show mercy."

Chi Buzi actually understood that if Xiao Chuting truly reached the Golden Core realm, whether he chose to act or not would ultimately have little to do with any promise. Yet, before departing, he spoke these words nonetheless. The words brushed past Xiao Chuting's ear like the wind, and the green-eyed young man's figure vanished like a flash of azure light into the dark waters.

During his years overseas, Xiao Chuting had, in fact, heard Chi Buzi's name long ago. This former genius of the Azure Pond Sect, who cultivated the Dao of Pristine Water and hailed from beneath the Pristine Pool, should have been utterly powerless.

'Pristine Water resides in the position of change; it surges forth only to fall. Its mastery is fleeting, and longevity invites change. Precisely because of this, the Purple Mystery trial for this path of change is inherently difficult to transcend.'

The five paths of Pristine, Blazing, Geng, Proclaimation, and Renewing are the 'positions of change.' They favor fluctuation and thus represent a tendency toward Intercalary matters. He had earlier used the analogy of three horses carrying the Dao for Li Zhouwei; this 'Intercalary horse' of change is particularly potent. It is strong in its youth but wanes late, proving a great hindrance to the true Dao!

Most Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters who cultivate these five virtues develop an 'Intercalary intent,' and countless among them have grown old and died before ever reaching the Purple Mystery!

'Back then, Chi Wei was so full of vigor... He transcended the divine ability trial with ease, yet he smashed himself bloody against this barrier. Seeing his lifespan dwindling, he finally gave rise to killing intent. If not for the technique to 'Converge the Pristine,' given his diminished longevity, it's highly likely he would have never been able to try attaining the Golden Core in his lifetime!'

'And his, Chi Buzi's, situation was not much better.'

And yet, despite also being from the Pristine Pool, he managed to transcend the Purple Mystery in less than three hundred years!

Although current rumors suggested Chi Buzi was in an equally difficult position, forced to rely on the Dragon-kin to escape the influence of Pristine Water, Xiao Chuting felt countless hidden thoughts stir within him as he watched him.

Chi Buzi had far too many reasons to help him.

The Dragon-kin backing Chi Buzi hoped for Xiao Chuting to achieve the Dao; the potential Origin Mansion faction behind Xiao Chuting possessed the Mansion Water methods Chi Buzi coveted; the Mansion Water that Chi Buzi would likely demand was intricately linked with his own Pit Water...

Just as Chi Buzi had implied when they met, Xiao Chuting knew Chi Buzi would help him, and Chi Buzi knew Xiao Chuting could cooperate with him. This was a tacit understanding between two who walked the Dao, a mutual comprehension that surpassed all apprehension and was more reassuring than any promise.

'But is that all there is to it?'

The old man moved with ease, the Pit Water enveloping him shifting constantly, flashing with a deep, ink-like luster. He traveled north along the gloomy marsh, yet the light within his eyes grew increasingly bright.

...

Mount Liangchuan.

Mount Liangchuan had not changed much from those years, save that the banners of the Ju clan had all been replaced by those of the Great Song. The radiance of divine abilities was far denser than before, threatening to surge into the very heavens.

Li Jiangqian traveled from Moongaze Lake, crossed the Jianghuai region, and arrived at Luoxia, but he did not find Yang Ruiyi. He found only Daoist Master Qiuhu—Ning Wan—stationed in Xiang Township.

Remarkably, this Fairy Qiuhu had already attained two divine abilities!

The cultivation of Cold Qi was relatively easy, yet Ning Wan had spent most of these years either injured or dealing with schemes, leaving her little time for true cultivation. Her easy success, clearly achieved without many failures, was a testament to her genuine skill.

Li Jiangqian congratulated her, then asked after Yang Ruiyi. Ning Wan replied,

"The Great General received orders and departed just moments ago. He is likely discussing important matters within the Exiled Qi, which is beyond our perception."

Li Jiangqian cared little who Yang Ruiyi was meeting and couldn't be bothered to wait. He immediately rode his Radiant Fire across the mountain range, and as he descended, a crimson divine ability surged to meet him. It resolved into a man in wide robes and a tall hat, bearing a refined and scholarly appearance. He bowed and said with a smile,

"Young Master!"

Although Li Jiangqian did not recognize the man, upon seeing his Azure Pond robes and identifying him as a Blazing Fire cultivator, he understood. He smiled and said,

"Senior Tantai!"

Tantai Jin shook his head in embarrassment, returning the salute hastily.

"I dare not accept the title of Senior... Please!"

Li Jiangqian, however, was in no hurry to land. He smiled and said,

"I have come this time to observe the situation in the north. There's no need to rush down into the array. Just find someone familiar with the situation to accompany me north for a look."

Tantai Jin paused for a moment, thoughtful, then said,

"Please!"

The two retracted their divine abilities and proceeded north in silence. Tantai Jin's expression soon turned solemn. They stopped just as the rolling northern mountain ranges came into view. Tantai Jin lowered his voice and said,

"Young Master, look to the west."

Li Jiangqian raised his gaze and scanned the area. In the distance, an immortal light blazed, a mixture of gold and white. Where the myriad radiances converged sat a city, nestled between two mountains, completely sealing off the gorge between them.

Tantai Jin said gravely,

"That place is Mianchi. It sits between Mount Xiang and the lesser peaks at the end of the Xiao Mountains. It is both a great prefecture and a strategic pass, serving as another gateway into the Guanzhong region. When the Zhou dynasty fell, Wei soldiers marched from here to battle the forces of Jin."

He sighed with some emotion and said,

"Mount Xiang and Mianchi have a long history and are considered great mountains, having survived to this day. The ancient Xia people refined salt here; salt pools were everywhere. Some of my Daoist ancestors also cultivated in this place."

He then turned his head to look east and said softly,

"That place is Huan Prefecture."

Li Jiangqian turned to look. Far to the east, several cities rested against the base of another mountain. Compared to Mianchi, they seemed dim and lackluster, almost ordinary.

Tantai Jin continued,

"Behind Huan Prefecture is Mount Daling. It and Mount Xiang, one to the east and one to the west, mark the entrance to the Jin region. If one does not travel into Jin, Mount Daling continues to the northeast, where another majestic mountain range follows an almost identical trajectory. This is the barrier of the Jin region, and it extends all the way to the lands of You and Yan. It is called the Taihang Mountains..."

He was a Tantai, after all, and possessed profound knowledge. He paused, then sighed,

"It is rumored that an immortal named Zhidu verified the Dao upon the Taihang Mountains. Once you pass the three prefectures along the eastern flank of the Taihang—Dangyin, Guangping, and Wei Prefecture—you reach the lands of Yan..."

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian suddenly frowned. A strange doubt surfaced in his mind, and he asked,

"Wei Prefecture?"

Tantai Jin was taken aback, then replied,

"Yes, Wei Prefecture..."

Li Jiangqian shook his head. His own family was the Wei-Li, making him unavoidably sensitive to the name 'Wei'. He figured it was just a place name and nothing more. He chuckled, shook his head, and said casually,

"It's rare to come across the name 'Wei'..."

Tantai Jin suddenly seemed to realize something and was visibly startled. He appeared to hesitate, debating whether to speak. After a long pause, he said in a low, somber voice,

"This place... during the time of the Qi, it was originally called 'Wei's Demise.' It was the Liang Emperor who changed it back."

The moment this was said, the golden-eyed young man beside him shot him a direct stare. His gaze was glacial and dangerous, yet his tone held a trace of a smile.

"Is there a story behind that?"

Tantai Jin's expression was complex. He said quietly,

"Legend says that Emperor Gong of Wei died violently during an eastern inspection tour, at the foot of the Taihang Mountains near the Heng and Zhang rivers. The Qi Emperor therefore designated these three territories, combined them into a single prefecture, and named it 'Wei's Demise'—which is the Wei Prefecture of today!"
