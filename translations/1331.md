# Chapter 1331: The Blazing Transformation

Multicolored light flickered in the Great Void as two nearly invisible streaks of light passed through. Beneath a veil of fire, an old face remained placid. Longkang Yao held his palm upward, where a jade talisman leaped, pulsing with searing flames.

"Li Zhouwei... has already gone to High-Peak City."

The man beside him was deep in thought, seeming rather uneasy. Upon hearing these words, his heart settled slightly.

"Who sent word?"

Longkang Yao replied casually, "From the grotto-heaven, Daoist Master Yu was dispatched. Given his cautious nature, he certainly won't leave High-Peak City lightly. He most likely sent someone to scout, and I fear that scout has met with misfortune."

"Still... it's of little consequence. We have him surrounded, and if we can pin him down here without needing to inflict serious harm, just delaying him for a few days, Daoist Master Gu will naturally be able to conquer Juan City."

Jiang Fuwang was fraught with worry.

"So... another has surrendered to them. Sometimes I fail to see it clearly. The lands illuminated by the Bright Yang cannot help but submit. He is not hesitant to act, and for every one that defects, our own numbers dwindle. Even if we capture him, I doubt... men like Qiao Sanyi will ever submit to our command."

"You're wrong about that."

Longkang Yao's gaze turned cold.

"Don't mistake Qiao Sanyi for a good man. He is rational, but also lecherous. He is cautious, but also greedy. When he truly has no other choice, he will have no recourse but to return, and as long as he returns, the battle is more than half won."

He continued in a low voice, "Once the first returns, a second is sure to follow. Right now, we are just missing that first one."

Jiang Fuwang's brows furrowed deeply as he stood with his hands clasped behind his back. He was about to say more when he noticed the distant scenery gradually coming into view. The Great Void's fluctuations grew more intense, and a faint, intermittent, and stagnant wave responded to their presence.

The two exchanged a look, their hearts calming somewhat.

What did this mean?

The Chefu grand array was intact!

As the fluctuations from the grand formation washed over them, Jiang Fuwang considered for a moment, then suddenly moved to slightly block the Great Daoist Master.

"Did he truly go to High-Peak City?"

Longkang Yao nodded.

"I know you dislike our young friend Pang, but he is capable. Before Daoist Master Yu left for High-Peak City, he made a special trip to give him a warning, saying: The Chefu formation is thin. You must ask the Qi clan to hurry there and stand guard in my stead."

"The Qi clan is the least likely to surrender to King Wei."

Only then did Jiang Fuwang nod lightly.

"Good."

He raised his eyes and saw, as expected, a surging blood-light in the Great Void—a divine ability from Balanced Ritual. He immediately prepared his own divine ability, about to ride the wind forward, but the expression on Longkang Yao beside him changed abruptly!

A crimson light flared between his brows as a sense of crisis washed over him. In that instant, the Great Daoist Master did not hesitate to form a divine ability, and fluttering flames cascaded down from his face, spreading across his entire body.

Emissary of Aridity!

As a Great Daoist Master with profound cultivation, the moment Longkang Yao's divine ability flared to life, the entire Great Void was plunged into a raging sea of fire. His eyes became a hazy crimson, filled with shock and terror as they focused on the space above, and indeed, he saw that streak of gold descending from the heavens!

Pure Yang Bracelets!

"We've fallen into a trap!"

Even with his lightning-fast reflexes, in that sudden instant, he only had time to activate his divine ability. The golden radiance had already fallen upon his face, forcing his head up in a flash, the light in his eyes falling into disarray as his mind and spirit were thrown into chaos, rendering him immobile!

At the same time, immense pressure from the Great Void descended abruptly. The Chefu grand array activated, like a profound mountain crashing down, pinning the two of them in place as the sky was plunged into a moment of pitch-black darkness.

Jiang Fuwang's vision was instantly filled with golden light.

In the darkness, a long halberd, as sharp as gold, was descending.

A bone-chilling cold had completely enveloped the body of this master from the Jiang Family.

He, Jiang Fuwang, had fought Li Zhouwei before!

Jiang Fuwang's combat prowess was actually quite renowned. He cultivated Geng Metal and possessed two divine abilities: one was Heavenly Gilded Helm, and the other was Engraved Stone. Both were Geng Metal combat abilities, enough for him to hold his own, not even falling short when facing some opponents with three divine abilities.

Yet it was precisely such a Purple Mansion Realm expert who had absolutely no leeway against Li Zhouwei.

There was no other reason for it. In a battle between Purple Mansion Realms, to use weakness against strength and buy time, one had to pit one's advantages against the opponent's shortcomings. Facing a tyrannical divine ability like the White Qilin's, one either had to be like Qiao Sanyi, with ample room to maneuver, or like Yu Xi, impervious to all harm. Jiang Fuwang's fighting style was extremely similar to Li Zhouwei's—meeting force with force. Evasion and delay were already his weaknesses, while his strengths couldn't compare to even a fraction of his opponent's...

Back then, this White Qilin had only possessed three divine abilities, yet he had already suppressed him in Aiding City. If not for the adaptability of his Heavenly Gilded Helm, he would have nearly lost his life. Now, with four methods of Bright Yang gathered, the power that accompanied them was even more terrifying.

He only had time to raise his hand, his divine ability converging and rapidly climbing onto his face.

Heavenly Gilded Helm!

In the next instant, the gold-white divine ability and the whistling long halberd flashed before him at the same time, letting out a teeth-grating clang, followed by the resonant sound of a sword being drawn.

Sword of King Jing of Wei.

The world turned bleak, and blood fell like rain.

Li Zhouwei had set this ambush, knowing full well who was coming. He struck with his full power, intending to first break this wingman, allowing him no chance to recover. What flashed next before the Jiang Family master was a brilliant Searing light.

Southern Emperor's Profound Snare!

Radiant Fire incinerates Geng Metal. Li Zhouwei's Bright Yang was now at the stage of great accomplishment, and his life-mandate had surged. Even the Lesser Yin who controlled water and fire would vomit blood from this Southern Emperor's Profound Snare, let alone a cultivator of Geng Metal.

At this critical juncture, Longkang Yao's eyes blazed, his anger raging. The colors of his divine ability flowed and shifted, illuminating the sky.

Grasping the Blazing Summer!

The Great Void, originally isolated by the formation, began to tremble violently. The various mysteries originating from the water and fire of true qi actually began to loosen, replaced by a boiling, arid heat that filled the entire sky. It not only manifested externally but also submerged all killing intent, as the flames within the fiery sea climbed and rose, shrouding Jiang Fuwang.

But in that instant, a Lesser Yin radiance emerged. Qiao Wenliu was already high in the sky, a smile on his face, oe hand pressed to his chest. His mouth opened wide as he inhaled with all his might.

Profound Method of Accommodating Water and Fire!

This was the very art that had made Qiao Wenliu famous, the supreme method he had refined his entire life, known as: Beneath the Master of Yin and Yang, between the realms of Water and Fire, there is nothing it cannot accommodate!

It was the perfect counter to Blazing Fire!

The Great Daoist Master's divine ability, Grasping the Blazing Summer, which had enveloped the sky and reached Jiang Fuwang, actually receded in that moment. It scattered and drifted, transforming into a single speck of crimson light, just like the Crimson Severing Arrowhead that day, and was drawn into his mouth.

Qiao Wenliu only coughed twice, but the joy on his face had already faded.

'It really is him... the Blazing Fire Great Daoist Master. This will not be easy...'

Li Zhouwei was not the least bit surprised—he had brought Qiao Wenliu precisely because the man had reached the level of Yehui and Changyun, and could intervene in a battle between Great Daoist Masters!

In a flash, a pulsating golden Searing light drifted down like a chain of utmost heat and pain, wrapping itself tightly around the Jiang Family master. Billowing light and black smoke erupted, turning his eyes crimson in an instant.

"You!"

Longkang Yao had been famous for ages and had never crossed hands with Qiao Wenliu. Caught off guard for a moment, he was both shocked and irritated. His eyes turned gloomy as he placed a hand on his waist and abruptly drew a sword.

The sword was quite long and entirely crimson, its surface seeming to crawl with the patterns of countless birds. He held it in a two-handed reverse grip, and it spanned the sky, sweeping up a sky-high crimson wave as he viciously chopped down!

But from a gloomy corner, a continuous aura emanated amidst uneven shadows. A small, thin old man turned and flipped his sleeve. He kept his head down, not daring to look at the Great Daoist Master, but his hands moved with incredible speed, forming a series of seals as a pitch-black radiance instantly spread.

Chamber of Doubt.

A mysterious palace was born from the void, complete with opposing eastern and western side-chambers, swallowing all the surging flames whole. The old man's face instantly flushed crimson, and he fought the urge to cough, forced to unleash his divine ability with all his might. In the courtyard, a revered sundial appeared, glowing faintly in the darkness, and actually suppressed all the flames!

"Another mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert!"

Longkang Yao did not know his depth, and his expression changed abruptly. He then realized that a golden light was already flashing before him. A golden, afterimage-like figure rushed toward him, a brilliant iron fist whistling through the air, aimed squarely at his face!

*Boom!*

His head was once again thrown back. Even with the protection of his divine ability, it still twisted and deformed, and sprays of flame were blasted from the back of his head, forming a turbulent stream of firelight in the Great Void.

Li Zhouwei had already closed the distance!

And what of Jiang Fuwang?

The Jiang Family master had no time to struggle free from the Radiant Fire. He lifted his head to see a sky-piercing golden object in the Great Void. It was majestic in form, its dark gold color thick, like gold powder mixed with silver sand!

Illustrious-Yang King's Battle Axe!

This single glance made the fine hairs all over his body stand on end. Fortunately, the killing intent rushing toward him was not intense—this King's Axe was actually hanging upside down; it had already transformed into the size of a small mountain, and the back of the axe faced him, a full thousand feet wide!

His injuries were untreated, Radiant Fire covered his entire body, and for a moment he could not escape. He could only watch helplessly as the golden mass smashed down.

"Boom!"

The impact knocked him out of the Great Void like a fallen star crashing to the earth. The Illustrious-Yang King's Battle Axe, as large as a mountain peak, planted itself upside down in the ground, pinning him as if suppressing an ant. In that moment, the earth shook and mountains swayed, the heavens and earth changed color, drawing the attention of all!

Jiang Fuwang felt as if a colossal weight was pressing down on him. His various injuries flared up, and he couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood. Fortunately, his dharma body was exceedingly strong, and he immediately used both hands to brace the axe, attempting to lift it.

But the tail of the axe was raised high, and at some unknown point, a small jade talisman had been hung from it. It manifested at the same time, resembling a giant plaque, with a continuous line of golden characters flashing one by one.

Mountain's Edge Talisman.

This item had been obtained from the Wei clan's Mountain's Edge Hall back then. Li Zhouwei had intended to give it to Li Ximing but was refused, so it had remained hanging from the hilt of the Illustrious-Yang King's Battle Axe ever since. In this instant, it shone brightly.

Loyal Vassal's Profound Light!

This Spiritual Artifact was exceptionally unique. A mere flick of a divine ability was all it took for it to act as if someone were personally wielding it to suppress a foe. Jiang Fuwang was already breathless, his body burning with Radiant Fire. Pinned by this profound light, he was utterly unable to rise!

The light of Balanced Ritual was rapidly approaching!

And in that fleeting moment, the battle in the sky had reached a fever pitch.

In that instant, Li Zhouwei had already thrown a hundred punches, firmly suppressing the Great Daoist Master. The brilliant Heavenly Light was like a waterfall, smothering all the flames in the sky.

Longkang Yao cultivated Blazing Fire and was a Great Daoist Master; the transformations of his body were endless!

His figure flickered in and out of existence, constantly twisting and changing within the Heavenly Light, yet he remained largely unharmed. However, he was no sword cultivator and the weapon in his hand was a Dharma Art Sword. Li Zhouwei was experienced, and in that instant, he prevented him from drawing his sword or casting his arts, leaving him no room to maneuver. Meanwhile, the other two watched like tigers, their divine abilities constantly responding to coordinate the encirclement.

Longkang Yao had achieved the Dao many years ago and showed no change in expression. He even glanced at Wu Miao to the side, finally seeing through him. A hint of disdain appeared in his eyes. He finally took one of the gleaming golden fists head-on, spraying a mouthful of blood, but a smile touched his eyes as he pinched his fingers together and moved his lips.

Burning the Old Chamber!

Also known as Burning of All Under Heaven!

The moment Longkang Yao used his famous divine ability, an invisible colored light rippled outward. In the sky, the Chamber of Doubt shattered like a broken pavilion, utterly disintegrating. The Blazing Fire Dharma Art trapped within surged out, and even Qiao Wenliu's Taichong Observation fluctuated endlessly, making it difficult for him to extricate himself.

And under the White Qilin's next punch, his face shattered like broken oil-paper, exploding into tens of thousands of heads of varying sizes. They shot outwards, each bearing the likeness of Longkang Yao, and spread across the sky!

These heads, some as small as grains of rice, others the size of a fingernail, all opened their mouths and spewed forth fire with a great roar. The vast sea of flames actually severed spiritual sense, once again consuming the entire sky.

"Cough, cough..."

Following this was a muffled grunt from Qiao Wenliu. The divine ability Grasping the Blazing Summer that he held in his mouth could finally be contained no longer. It whistled out, merging all the flames into a single sheet, painting the world a deep red.

The crimson light illuminated Li Zhouwei's face. In his golden eyes, he saw three figures standing within the flames. They held a sword, an axe, and a gourd respectively, and all were 'Longkang Yao'.

The one in the center, without the slightest hesitation, pointed his Dharma Art Sword directly at Li Zhouwei with a cold gaze. The light on the sword condensed to an extreme, like a vast river pouring down.

Even with Jiang Fuwang suppressed, there was not a hint of panic in the Great Daoist Master's voice, only a chilling calm.

"I have cultivated the Purple Mystery for fifty-six years and have never known defeat. Even the old Daoist Master of the Han Family must show me three parts respect. Three junior cultivators... dare to encircle me, a four-divine-ability user of Blazing Fire? So ignorant, so fearless!"

King Wei's gaze was placid.

'Burning of All Under Heaven...'

He could see clearly that the Longkang Yao before him was the true body, but the two forms conjured from spiritual fire were by no means weak. Wu Miao would likely not be able to defeat his opponent easily, and for a short time, they could even hold off Qiao Wenliu!

A trace of surprise finally flashed in his eyes.

"A man from Chun City, after all... Burning the Old Chamber..."

This King Wei could feel the destructive, fiery aura emanating from his opponent—it was a seething killing intent and restlessness that threatened to shatter all order.

At this moment, whether it was Imperial Observation of the Origin or Chamber of Doubt, or any of the various divine abilities that severed, sealed, created domains, suppressed, or wore down an enemy, all of them paled before this flame.

Li Zhouwei's Imperial Observation of the Origin seemed to have been provoked, and in that instant, it responded automatically. Held internally, it was the 'Observation of the Three Yangs'. Raging Merging Fire burned across his body, similarly seething with killing intent.

Tit for tat.

"No wonder you are so confident... So it is... you are not afraid of my divine ability..."

For once, Li Zhouwei was not dressed in his usual ink-black robes, but in a simple white one. This made him seem less domineering and fierce, and more ethereal and free, like an Immortal. Standing amidst the fire, the four points of light of the Sun-Surging Governing Stars between his brows brightened bit by bit.

There was a hint of a smile in his golden eyes.

"Your divine ability... is far more effective against me than Lu Fu's Present Departs Old was back then... Truly, some things are destined to counter others... Perfect."

But as the last word left his lips, his figure had already vanished. Like a stampeding beast, he smashed the surging flames and dharma light into pieces.

"Boom!"

Six arms shot out like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Surging dark light rose up with the Merging Fire, and hues of black and gold crawled up his neck to the corners of his eyes, gradually enveloping his face.

"Since I began cultivating the Purple Mystery, this King has not yet met a worthy opponent..."

He stood in the fire like a demon god, his voice hoarse yet elegant.

"Fellow Daoist, you are the first."
