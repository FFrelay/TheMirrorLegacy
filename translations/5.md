# Chapter 5: An Immortal Opportunity is Hard to Come By

"Back then, during the war with the Eastern Yue, they had numerous shamans who commanded miasma, snakes, and insects; the army distributed talismans like this to defend against their shamanic arts. This talisman saved my life, but now its divine light has faded, leaving it like a sheet of worthless paper. This is the second item."

"The Eastern Yue favor adornments of beast bones, feathers, and glazed glass; I killed some of them and looted these valuables from their corpses. This is the third."

"Tomorrow, I will take this piece of glazed glass and tell your Second Uncle that Xiangping found it in the river. Regardless of whether Li Yecheng saw anything or not, we will insist it is just a shard of broken glass that happened to glitter under the moonlight."

Li Mutian produced a shard of broken glass, put the items away, and spoke softly to Li Tongya.

"Father is very thorough." Li Changhu nodded. "Second Uncle is a generous man who understands the greater picture; he won't haggle over something like this."

"It's a pity Li Yecheng is such a waste," Li Tongya said quietly, turning his head to look at his father.

Li Mutian picked up the mirror, set it on the wooden table, and shook his head.

"Now, we must figure out what this treasure does and how to use it. If we're not careful, this could all be for nothing, like drawing water with a bamboo basket."

Lu Jiangxian had been listening from within the mirror the entire time, and a plan began to form. He was immobile inside the mirror; whether to protect himself or to one day escape, if he wanted to find a path he too could walk upon the long road of the Immortal Dao, he would undoubtedly need to borrow the human and material resources of this land.

The Li family were farmers by origin, their foundation shallow, yet these few members were all exceptional.

The father, Li Mutian, possessed superior courage and insight; the eldest son, Li Changhu, was tactful and magnanimous; the second son, Li Tongya, was brave, sharp, and decisive, daring to fight and strive. Li Xiangping and Li Chejing were also clever and agile. They were truly the optimal choice for an alliance.

Besides, he had no hands or legs, he couldn't walk or run, let alone find someone else. Should he just remain silent, be thrown back into the river like trash, and endure another hundred years of silent imprisonment?

'No matter what, I must first get them to go north for a look, even if it's just a glance from afar.' At this thought, Lu Jiangxian urged the flow of energy within his body to surge toward the mirror's upper-left corner.

Inside the house, the Li brothers clustered around the mirror, tinkering for half a day to no avail, all the while terrified of cracking it and destroying their immortal opportunity. The moonlight it held felt as cool and comfortable as water to the touch, but it couldn't be blown or drawn out.

It wasn't until Li Xiangping picked up the mirror and gently stroked its surface that Lu Jiangxian circulated his energy to activate it. The mirror's upper-left corner abruptly lit up, startling Li Xiangping so much he trembled, crying out repeatedly, unsure whether to hold on or let go.

Li Tongya moved closer to look. A bright white arc of light, thin at the ends and thick in the middle, had appeared in the upper-left corner of the mirror, looking utterly beautiful. It only began to dim slowly after several breaths.

"Brother, it lit up!" Li Xiangping exclaimed in a hushed, excited voice.

Li Tongya took the mirror and, imitating Li Xiangping, stroked its surface; sure enough, a white light glowed. He passed the mirror to his father, signaling him to do the same.

Li Mutian and Li Changhu both stroked the mirror in turn, clucking their tongues in praise.

Li Tongya, however, let out a soft sound of surprise, took the mirror back from his elder brother, and stroked it with his back to the others.

"Father, no matter where we stroke this thing, the light it emits always points north. Just like..." Li Tongya stared at the mirror in his hands and spoke gravely.

"A south-pointer," Li Mutian nodded.

'This kid is brilliant! He gets it instantly!' Lu Jiangxian cheered inwardly.

"First, let's go to the village entrance."

Li Mutian stroked his beard, then turned and went back into the house, calling to his children.

"Get a string of cured meat. We're going to visit the Teacher."

————

Li Yecheng wiped his eyes as he entered his front yard, cursing and kicking at the stones in his path.

"What kind of treasure are they hiding? A bunch of idiots treating it like gold. Those damned turtles even brought knives to look in the middle of the night. They're clearly guilty about something!" He sat down on a stone, a new thought striking him.

"Li Mutian was out messing around for over twenty years; he must have plenty of good things on him! He definitely has a treasure." He quietly made his own calculations.

"But those damned turtles are all stubborn and unyielding; you can't even pry mud from between their fingers. That old man is old and obstinate, he refuses to talk, always keeping his secrets guarded. If only Li Mutian was dead, we would get a share of his things!"

Li Yecheng tilted his head to look at the courtyard gate just as his younger brother, Li Yesheng, entered timidly.

He glared and shouted, "You brat, get over here!"

He grabbed his brother's clothes and threw him toward the front of the house. Li Yesheng took a miserable tumble on the ground and shrank into a fearful ball.

"I heard you're on good terms with that runt Li Xiangping. Tomorrow, you go to his house and steal a couple of melons for me to eat," he cursed viciously.

————

Li Mutian led his three sons from the end of the village to the entrance. Along the way, a villager resting on his doorstep smiled and called out a greeting,

"Uncle Mutian! Where are you headed?"

"Just taking something to the Teacher!"

Li Mutian smiled, lifting the cured meat in his hand.

When they reached the village entrance, Li Mutian looked around, then patted Li Tongya and Li Xiangping on the shoulders.

"Go," he said in a low voice.

The two understood. They ducked down and vanished into the dense reed marsh.

Li Mutian stared worriedly into the-distance. His eldest son couldn't help but remind him,

"We should have instructed them that if they encounter anything strange, they should only watch from afar and then retreat immediately. They must not linger."

"Tongya knows what to do."

Li Mutian squinted, myriad calculations flashing through his mind like fleeting shadows.

He knew he might lose two sons tonight, but he would still have Li Changhu to carry on the family line. Yet, the boys might also return safely, bringing the Li family an opportunity for great advancement. He felt a deep, agonizing guilt and clenched his fists tightly.

"Two hundred years."

The Li family had toiled on this land, facing the yellow earth with their backs to the sky, for two entire centuries. Faced with this potential opportunity, Li Mutian rationally made the choice that best served his family's interests, yet he was tormented by the emotional cost.

"Brother Li!"

The courtyard gate suddenly swung open, shattering Li Mutian's thoughts. The teacher, Han Wenxu, stood there holding a small bowl, staring blankly at him.

"Teacher."

A hearty smile spread across Li Mutian's face. He strode forward to the stoop and placed the cured meat on the wooden table.

"You really shouldn't have," Han Wenxu said, smiling and nodding.

He took the cured meat, cut off a piece and thinly sliced it onto a small plate, then stir-fried some pickled vegetables and served them on another small plate. The two men moved a small table, poured two small cups of rice wine, and sat by the door, beginning to chat.

"Those immortals flying high up in the sky... it seems they've finally stopped coming." Li Mutian let out a long sigh, his expression visibly relaxing.

Han Wenxu shrugged, then replied with an envious cluck of his tongue.

"Immortals, eh? When I was twelve, an immortal came to our town." He pressed his lips together, his voice tinged with melancholy.

"He said he was searching for those with 'opened apertures.' In the entire town of over a thousand children, he found only three. He took those three with him. Among those immortals flying high in the sky today, perhaps one of them is from my hometown."

"An immortal opportunity is hard to come by," Li Mutian said comfortingly after a long silence.

"Immortal opportunity is hard to come by, so hard to come by..."

Han Wenxu stared blankly at the moon, repeating the phrase over and over.

The two men, each weighed down by their own heavy concerns, fell silent.
