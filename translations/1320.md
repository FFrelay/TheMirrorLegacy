# Chapter 1320: Si Canal

Li Zhouwei gazed at him, his voice echoing between heaven and earth.

"This King will designate a location. The rest, I will trouble Uncle to handle."

There was a moment of silence in the darkness. The Dragon King stepped forward on the river surface, his voice hoarse,

"As long as King Wei desires it, what would my Hornless Dragon lineage begrudge?"

He laughed.

"Chongzhou is merely ordinary. Even in a major province like Yinzhou, we could construct a Yin Abode for you, King Wei!"

The golden-eyed youth parted his lips,

"The Deer Weeds Islands. Long Helm."

Long Helm Island.

The Deer Weeds Islands lay in the eastern reaches of the Eastern Sea, extremely close to the World's Navel. There were two major islands: Deer Weeds and Long Helm, with the latter being slightly larger. On these very islands, the Li family's forces were currently present.

The Wave-Suppressing Mansion!

This answer seemed hardly unexpected, yet made a trace of coldness flash through the Dragon King's eyes. Everyone present was a first-rate wielder of divine abilities in the mortal real—how could they not understand Li Zhouwei's meaning?

The World's Navel, where the Valley Water lay!

'Chongzhou? Meaningless; it would just occupy the Cui clan's territory for nothing. Yinzhou? It looks large, but the Dragon-kin themselves dare not speak freely in that province, yet he wants my Yin Abode to be built there?'

If Li Zhouwei's Yin Abode were built beneath the World's Navel in the east, he might gain the assistance of that True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation. Leaving aside whether relying on the concealing characteristics of the Valley Water would allow his aura to rise to another level, if a great war were to truly break out, he would have far greater freedom of action!

The youth stood in the darkness, his tone unchanging, yet he returned the words spoken just moments ago.

"The Dragon King... will not refuse me."

Even though this True Monarch of Valley Water nearly ruined the Dragon-kin's grand plan not long ago, nearly triggering an unprecedented war of True Monarchs, and even joined forces with the cultivators of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition to suppress Beijia's attempt to save the situation...

But as long as the pressure from Heavenly Glow was great enough, what was there that could not be set aside?

As expected, at this very moment, the Dragon King of the Hornless Dragon lineage still bloomed with a brilliant smile, saying,

"My Hornless Dragon lineage said the Eastern Sea was suitable. Deer Weeds is also within the Eastern Sea, so naturally, we will not go back on our word."

"A pity..."

His scarlet gaze swept through the darkness, seemingly carrying a hint of regret.

"A pity... that great figure moved to obstruct the Dao and suffered heavy injuries... I fear She cannot look after King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei smiled, "No matter."

The dragon pondered in the darkness for a moment, then gave a low laugh.

"The people of the Cui clan have already arrived in the sea and have been settled these past few days. Since King Wei has decided, I shall send various Demon beasts to accompany you. Starting today, we will construct the Yin Abode for King Wei."

"This second matter, however, is a request from my Hornless Dragon lineage."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Uncle, please speak."

Dongfang Lieyun's gaze swept across the darkness without leaving a trace, lingering briefly in two corners of the horizon as if weighing his words. His speech was firm yet steady,

"There is a major river vein whose lower reaches approach Jianghuai and connect to White Sea Creek. From the fish platform lake where the Lotus Temple is located northward, the upper reaches have always bordered the vicinity of Mount Dayang. It is named 'Si'. For many years, it has appeared and disappeared intermittently, and the water vein has not flourished."

"Upstream of the Si River, no more than a hundred miles from the Great River, I wish for King Wei to dig a canal to guide the river water into the Si, connecting it to White Sea Creek and flowing directly into the sea."

The youth considered this for a moment, then spoke with interest,

"The Hornless Dragon lineage is suddenly managing water veins? I wonder what the reason might be?"

Dongfang Lieyun gazed at him and laughed,

"Water veins are inherently the heavenly duty of my Hornless Dragon lineage. It is just that my lineage is building a tomb for King Wei, so we seek to reciprocate by borrowing King Wei's hand!"

"As for the reason."

The Dragon King smiled,

"Dragon Monarch Beijia has achieved the Dao, and the Great River seized the Ji and flowed away. Now that the Great River enters the sea, it follows what was originally the riverbed of the Ji Water, leaving only this tributary still called the Ji Water... The Great River and Ji are one. Integrating the Great River into the Si is to expand the authority of our Dragon Monarch. Why would that be impermissible?"

Although his words were plain, the youth before him was sharp enough to have thoughts of his own. He gazed at the Dragon King standing on the river surface, recalling the words of that Dragon Prince from earlier in his heart.

'The Six Waters: the Great River, the Jiang, the Ji, the Huai, the Ying, and the Si.'

'The Si... I fear that relates to one of the six sons of the Converging Water Hornless Dragon!'

It must be known that there were two Dragon Monarchs in the world today. Beijia was the only manifest Converging Water Dragon Monarch, one of the six sons, and now held the Fruition Attainment. That Dragon Monarch Xiyang was clearly one of the three parts born of Lesser Yang, not one of the six sons. There were even rumors that another Hornless Dragon son was still alive...

'Rijiu and Yuezhu were the eldest and second sons of the True Hornless Dragon... dwelling in the Great River and the Jiang respectively...'

The Qilin gazed at him and said,

"I actually have a question for the Dragon King."

"The current Master of Converging Water—where does he rank?"

Dongfang Lieyun did not hesitate, smiling, "Third."

Li Zhouwei's gaze shifted slightly.

'As expected! The Great River, Jiang, Ji, Huai, Ying, and Si—these correspond to the ranking order of the Converging Water Dragon Monarchs.'

'Since that is the case, the fourth son of the Hornless Dragon was also of Converging Water and dominated the Huai Water. His fall facilitated the "Water Descends, Lightning Ascends". The sixth is Pristine Water, which cannot be counted. Then the Si River is either the seventh, Dongfang Tianye, or that one Dragon Monarch of Converging Water whose name is unknown and who, by all logic, should have already fallen...'

'If it is truly an annexation, why would He bother doing these things today... These Converging Water Dragon Monarchs all fell many years ago, so what is there to suspect...'

Li Zhouwei did not know the depth of this matter and should not have agreed, but now that the Hornless Dragon lineage was here on the Ji Water, how could they casually reveal their true purpose to him? His heart slowly sank, but the Dragon King only gazed at him and smiled,

"This is not a request from my White Dragon Shrine."

His attitude was already extremely blunt.

This was the will of the Hornless Dragon lineage.

Li Zhouwei was not surprised—how could words spoken before the three great powers represent the view of a single shrine? This King Wei looked at Dongfang Lieyun and suddenly said,

"I have heard... the White Shrine are descendants of Dragon Monarch Rijiu, and the Black Shrine are descendants of Dragon Monarch Yuezhu. I do not know about the descendants of the current Master of Converging Water..."

Li Zhouwei had long harbored doubts.

The Dragon-kin were imposing and aggressive, yet the ones with the greatest prestige were not the descendants of the current Beijia, but the descendants of the late Rijiu and Yuezhu. Meanwhile, not even a shadow could be found of the current Dragon Monarch's bloodline!

He saw the Dragon King sneer, saying,

"Let the Qilin know: the nine great lords of my lineage were sons of the Great Sage, born of the same mother. They had descendants only after death. The six Dragon Monarchs hold the Converging Position. Following the ancient story, how could they have children? When a Dragon Monarch is at his peak, he naturally has never established a shrine!"

These words finally brought illumination to the Qilin's heart.

'So that is how it is!'

The True Hornless Dragon only divided into nine upon death!

Although these sons of the Hornless Dragon within the Converging Water could not compare to the True Hornless Dragon, they still had to uphold the intent of Converging Water. How could they have children? Beijia has now entered the Converging Water Fruition Attainment, making the act of descendants inheriting the shrine even more taboo!

That was why there were only the Black and White Shrines. Because Dongfang Rijiu and Dongfang Yuezhu had already fallen long ago, these dragon sons and grandsons were able to traverse the world unhindered...

He had not expected that, while failing to ask about the details, he would unexpectedly gain a different harvest. His heart pounded, so he composed his expression and replied,

"My offense..."

"No matter."

The Dragon King smiled, speaking indifferently,

"The scarcity of my Dragon Race's offspring is precisely due to this reason. It corresponds to the unwillingness to divide the Converging Water bloodline while not yet fallen. But we are not the Ancient Hornless Dragon who was close to the bloodline. When we fall, we truly fall..."

"My shrine was established at the time of the Dragon Monarch's fall. Even up to the third generation, there is still the principle of death dividing into six or three. If one dies seeking the Dao, the Metallic Essence might split into six or nine; it is not strange!"

He seemed to recall something, and a trace of complexity flashed through his eyes. However, he took this opportunity to interrupt the Wei King's intent to question further, smiling,

"King Wei... how have you considered it?"

Li Zhouwei paused slightly, shaking his head noncommittally,

"If Uncle has a request, this nephew will do his utmost. But discussing the matter on its own merits, since Uncle mentioned a friendship of a thousand years, constructing the tomb was a promise to Emperor Wei. The old matters are concluded. How can you use that today to seek repayment from me?"

The expression in his eyes fluctuated as he spoke softly,

"As long as the Hornless Dragon lineage can do me a small favor, not only regarding the Yin Abode matter where my Li family can provide manpower and cultivators with divine abilities to fully cooperate, but regarding the Si River matter, this King will also go all out!"

Dongfang Lieyun showed a surprised expression for the first time, saying,

"Since that is the case, King Wei's request is..."

Only at this moment did a trace of a genuine smile finally appear on Li Zhouwei's face. He said,

"I want the Hornless Dragon lineage... to stall the Yan Kingdom for me."

The dagger was finally revealed!

He was currently blocked outside Gu Prefecture, facing the various Daoist Masters of Gu Prefecture who had already gathered, while the Yan Kingdom watched covetously from behind. It was actually quite awkward. But if he were unprepared, how would he have easily risked his life?

He had long prepared two paths for himself.

'There are two chances to break the deadlock... First, leave the cultivators to guard this place while I alone bypass these two passes, secretly circling from the southern Lotus Temple territory, heading straight for the south of Gu Prefecture. With the strength of one person, I will strike at their weak points, contact the lands of Qi, and stir up the winds and clouds!'

With the Lotus Temple's territory currently empty and the precedent of many friendly interactions, the difficulty for Li Zhouwei to pass through that place was definitely not great!

'Second, rely on the Dragon-kin!'

Li Zhouwei's stepping onto the Ji Water at this time, and contacting the Dragon-kin at this location, inherently carried deeper considerations!

The Yan Kingdom was different from the Zhao State. Its sea borders were long. The Dragon-kin and the Yan Kingdom inherently had conflicts of interest in the Eastern Sea. In the past, it was precisely because of multiple struggles that the Compassion Dao was prevented from moving south easily.

As long as he could reach an agreement with the Dragon-kin, causing the White Dragon Shrine to act and stall the Yan Kingdom, denying this major threat a chance to strike, the difficulty of conquering Gu Prefecture would change drastically!

From the moment that fragment flashed in his vision, Li Zhouwei's resolve had reached its peak. Regardless of the price he had to pay, he had to kill his way into Gu Prefecture as soon as possible and seize that item!

His words resounded in the sky, causing the Dragon King before him to be slightly stunned. Dongfang Lieyun pondered for an instant, and a smile actually appeared on his face.

Was stalling the Yan Kingdom difficult for the Dragon-kin?

'It is as easy as turning over one's hand!'

His Hornless Dragon lineage possessed the entire Eastern Sea. Beneath the surface was an endless abyss, with Demon beasts numbering over ten million. These underwater domains were even larger than the mainland. In the outer seas, there were also large swathes of independent Demon beasts establishing their own strongholds, which his Hornless Dragon lineage was too lazy to go far to subdue... The vast Eastern Sea brought them unimaginable wealth and almost inexhaustible troops!

This was also why the so-called noble lineages were merely playthings in front of the Dragon Princes—there were simply too many Demon beasts in the sea, and almost all spiritual items were controlled by the Dragon-kin. The status of the Dragon-kin in the Eastern Sea could never be compared to the control over the mainland held by any faction in the history of the Three Profoundities!

Even the Thunder Palace could not!

Even though Demon beasts were naturally inferior to humans in cultivation and most had to rely on longevity to slowly accumulate, the Dragon-kin did not need to exert much effort to stall the Yan Kingdom. Relying on his White Dragon Shrine alone would be enough!

The true weakness of the Hornless Dragon lineage lay in the power of True Monarchs and those above! It was the great pain of the Pristine position being stolen by Du Qing in the past. The only thing truly held in the hands of the Dragon-kin was the Converging position, and the True Dragons schemed to prevent them from allowing more Converging Water True Monarchs to achieve the Dao...

Unless the Compassion Dao became truly enraged and a Dharma Aspect ordered intervention, they would be unable to extricate themselves from the quagmire of the Eastern Sea!

But precisely this point was what the Dragon King dreaded.

The White Dragon Shrine was not the sole power in the Eastern Sea. Once they agreed to Li Zhouwei, they would have to bear this matter themselves. The limits here were extremely difficult to grasp. If they truly pushed the Yan Kingdom to desperation and caused the loss of any dragon sons or grandsons, the White Dragon Shrine would have to bear it alone.

He could only take these words back and, using the name of the greater trend, get them all to act together. Controlling the limits well should not be difficult...

But he did not show this obviously. That layer of scarlet red concealed all fluctuations in his eyes. Instead, he slowly raised his gaze, revealing a tone of deliberation, and laughed,

"Regarding the Si River matter, King Wei said you would do your utmost. Regarding the Yan Kingdom matter, my Hornless Dragon lineage says these same four words—we will do our utmost!"

Li Zhouwei naturally understood his meaning, and the smile on his face brightened,

"That requires this King to fight his way to the Si River first, before I can do anything."

The Dragon King's gaze paused on his face for an instant, then slowly sank. Dongfang Lieyun said,

"The Dragon-kin will naturally provoke hostilities and besiege those temples in the Eastern Sea... But King Wei must also take note. The momentum of war is impermanent. The King of Yan is not same as the Emperor of Zhao. If he suddenly withdraws a piece, abandoning a few strongholds in the Eastern Sea to dispatch three or four wielders of divine abilities to attack through the gaps, do not blame it on the Dragon-kin."

Li Zhouwei laughed, "This King has his own plans."

The Dragon King raised his head. A white, wave-like mist surged from his nostrils, drifting like smoke in the darkness. Dongfang Lieyun gazed at him. This Dragon King Beihai remained silent for a long time, turned around, and finally spat out his words,

"Li Zhouwei."

"Look out for yourself!"

In an instant, the darkness in the sky receded like a tide. The calm water surface began to flow again, and the bright jade palace standing on the water vanished into nothingness under the moonlight. Everything dispersed like smoke and clouds.

In the gloomy field of vision, the figure from the Underworld in black clothes had already gone south. The dragon sons and grandsons dived into the river, and a patch of brilliant Treasure Light sped away, suddenly heading east.

Only the surging Ji River remained.

The mountains and forests were extremely quiet. The ink-clad youth stood motionless in the mountains, one hand resting on the precious sword at his waist. All words seemed to fade at this moment, leaving only deep contemplation.

'The people of Luoxia went east... are they going to Gu Prefecture?'

'The Dragon-kin agreed to stall the Yan Kingdom for me, but it will not happen that quickly... Since the people of Luoxia went east, it is likely Gu Prefecture will soon know as well. Yun Pass has numerous wielders of divine abilities, so there is no need to attack by force. Their divine abilities are gathering toward the west day by day. A forced attack will only drag things into a stalemate.'

His gaze paused on the distant pass for only an instant, then quickly shifted toward the south.

'I still need to borrow passage through the Lotus Temple to bypass these two passes!'
