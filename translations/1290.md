# Chapter 1290: Pit and Pristine

Li Jiangqian smiled and nodded, covertly observing the other's divine ability as he asked,

"So fast... It hasn't even been twenty years, has it?"

The period of ignorance varied in length; liberation supposedly relied on Dao-wisdom and was related to one's fate, yet these factors were not always effective, and often only the direct disciples of Golden Core lineages possessed one or two methods. For everyone else, even the direct offspring of those who had achieved a divine ability, falling into a state of ignorance until death could only be lamented as the impermanence of worldly affairs.

From antiquity to the present, the trial of ignorance and the trial of verifying the Purple Mystery had cut short the Dao paths of countless individuals and been the fortunate making of many others; Li Jiangliang's twenty years was truly a duration that ranked near the top.

But upon hearing his elder brother's words, he could only give a bitter smile and say,

"Elder brother, please don't mock me. The light of Martial Cultivation has the effect of reducing ignorance, and before my breakthrough, an elder even took me on a spirit journey into the Great Void. I didn't gain many benefits from it, and after struggling bitterly, I still dragged this out for twenty years. Within the family, I truly don't rank at all!"

"Compared to you and sister, Jiangliang can only be considered to have dull aptitude and shallow fortune."

Li Jiangqian, of course, understood perfectly well—other people's methods, whether reducing ignorance or spirit journeying in the Great Void, were like the various spirit medicines taken during a breakthrough in seclusion. They might add or subtract a fraction of a chance, but how could any of it compare to his own family?

'The Talisman Seed gives a little spin, and the entire ignorance vanishes without a trace!'

Fortunately, the specific timing of Li Jiangqian's breakthrough was rather vague to the outside world; he had been mindful of this, and now he couldn't help but laugh as he said,

"You and I are roughly on par, so there's no need to be modest. When it comes to profound fortune, that, naturally, must be Great-Uncle first."

His gaze shifted, and he asked with considerable interest,

"You formed a spirit fire?"

As their cultivation methods were identical, Li Jiangliang understood what he meant, immediately flipping his hand to reveal a handful of bright, hazy flames.

The fire was a yellowish-white color, appearing rather heavy and thick, and it cast a bright, silver-amber hue; it bore some resemblance to Li Jiangqian's Southern Brightness Heart-Fire, but looked as if it were mixed with a bit of white, making it less vivid.

Li Jiangqian was slightly surprised, saying,

"Its power isn't bad..."

Although Li Jiangliang's current spirit fire couldn't compare to his own, it was faintly a fraction stronger than the one he himself had condensed when he first achieved it!

Li Jiangliang quickly nodded and smiled,

"This fire is born from sensing the life-mandate. My life-mandate received the blessing of Martial Cultivation, so naturally, the fire has a bit more power!"

This was naturally far from comparable to Li Jiangqian, but it was still a decent starting point. Li Jiangqian finally understood and nodded thoughtfully. Li Ximing stepped forward, exchanged a few pleasantries, and then, as was customary, took out some medicinal pills for him, saying,

"I usually have some surplus from my pill refining. Your elder brother and sister received the same; you absolutely must not refuse."

Li Jiangliang had no choice but to accept. Li Jiangqian finally asked,

"Jiangliang, your visit this time... did you bring any orders?"

Li Jiangliang was, of course, paying his respects at the lake first after his breakthrough, but the timing was so close to the old appointment set by Li Zhouwei and Xiao Chuting that Li Jiangqian couldn't help but speculate. He had only to ask, and sure enough, he saw Li Jiangliang nod slightly and say:

"There is indeed a major matter to discuss with Father and you, Elder Brother."

He paused, then said in a low voice,

"Does the lake know of Daoist Master Xiao's whereabouts?"

Seeing Li Ximing shake his head, the young man said gravely,

"He traveled all the way south, meeting with the various old families, and even paid a visit to the Chen Clan. I heard he also paid respects to the elder in the Imperial Palace. Matters have been arranged properly. Three months ago, he departed from Jiangnan and headed north, to whereabouts unknown."

Li Jiangqian's gaze gradually grew solemn as he asked,

"The Imperial Palace... what is their view?"

Li Jiangliang said pensively,

"The Grand General has coveted the Xi Clan for a long time. For many years, he has only regretted having no opportunity to subjugate them. Now, with the Great Tomb River... the Grand General wishes to use the opportunities within... in exchange for Chunyi's obedience."

"At least, in name."

The young man was not surprised.

'The matter of Luoxia... Yang Ruiyi put in so much effort, there was bound to be a reason. So, it was for Chunyi...'

He asked in a low voice,

"Will this conflict with Daoist Master Xiao?"

In truth, this single sentence already made the lake's attitude clear. Li Jiangliang sighed inwardly, but said aloud,

"What they want is the Mansion Water, so it seems there won't be a major conflict. But Daoist Master Xiao's matter... do Father and you, Elder Brother, truly intend to intervene?"

His expression was inscrutable as he said,

"It is said... he cannot succeed. I hope the family handles this matter with caution..."

Li Jiangqian understood he must have heard something to be so certain; those two words, "it is said," were definitely not so simple. The young man sighed, shook his head, and said,

"Jiangliang, Daoist Master Xiao's grace to our family is as heavy as a mountain. Without Daoist Master Xiao... there would be no Li family of today!"

Li Jiangqian had a very accurate grasp of his younger brother's personality. Li Jiangliang knew a great deal, and might not have listened to an analysis of pros and cons, but the simple phrase "grace as heavy as a mountain" was enough to overwhelm him.

Li Jiangliang could only cup his hands and reply,

"This little brother understands. Father's third divine ability has only recently been fully cultivated, and he already suffered such heavy injuries. It would be best not to incur any more. Please, do what you can."

The emotion on his face subsided as he said softly,

"I also brought an order: all Daoist Masters are to rush to Luoxia, station themselves at Liangchuan, and prepare to enter Huan Prefecture."

Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes.

"At this moment?"

"At this very moment!"

Li Jiangliang's expression was grave as he said,

"Western Shu is already making moves, and people from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm are also heading south. The Grand General's intention is... at this critical juncture, the foundation at Luoxia must be secured, preferably with King Wei himself standing guard!"

Li Ximing's heart leaped.

Although Li Zhouwei hadn't explicitly said he intended to transcend the Purple Mystery, he had taken the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill from Li Ximing, so he naturally had some understanding of what King Wei was doing. Before he could reply, Li Jiangqian frowned instinctively and said,

"To tell you the truth, the family is currently occupied with the idea of constructing in the Great Void. Your cousin has been preparing for a long time and cannot be easily moved... As for Father..."

Li Jiangqian's expression remained unchanged as he said in a low voice,

"He finished healing his injuries some years ago, and even went out to observe the Profound Foundation. He only returned to seclusion a year ago to cultivate an important spell art. I was also in seclusion at the time, so we did not meet."

He added in a low voice,

"My personal estimation is that he likely plans to move against the Northern Cultivators and Northern Buddhists, setting an ambush before the Great Tomb River opens."

The Emissary of the True Light Cloud before him clearly had a strong grasp of the situation, and he nodded in deep agreement, saying in a low voice,

"If Father has arrangements, he can certainly send word to the Grand General. He is guarding Luoxia right now and is extremely vigilant; he also hopes to eliminate one or two strong enemies to awe the other cultivators."

If Li Zhouwei were not in seclusion, this would naturally be the best option, as ambushing one or two Northern Cultivators would serve multiple interests. But the situation was different now. Li Jiangqian wasn't about to gamble that the Underworld _also_ supported Xiao Chuting, so he deceived his younger brother along with everyone else.

Li Jiangliang, suspecting nothing, nodded deeply and said,

"Since it is so, I will first go to Luoxia to report, and await good news from the lake."

Li Jiangqian's eyes held a smile, his mind already running through calculations,

'Right now, we know nothing about the situation in Huan Prefecture, which is detrimental to future actions. Moreover, I can use this as a pretext to go there... first, to estimate the strength of the various parties, and second, with Spirit Probe, I might make some unexpected discoveries.'

'After some time passes and no news comes from the lake, Yang Ruiyi will inevitably come asking. I can use that as an opportunity to feign a return to the lake for discussion, and pass the information I've gathered to Father...'

The smile on his face grew even more brilliant.

"I will pack up here and then go to see the Grand General myself."

...

The great marsh was dim, the dense forest gloomy.

Distant clouds drifted along the horizon. A small shadow appeared upon the southern wilderness, pitch black at first, heading straight north, until soon, a hint of azure became visible.

An old man in a straw cape and hat approached at a slow walk, his steps seeming uneven and his gait laborious, yet he moved with deceptive speed, swiftly crossing the vast wilderness, passing innumerable ruins, and stepping into the depths of the marshland.

Xiao Chuting gazed silently for a moment.

In his youth, he, Xiao Chuting, had been trapped in Jiangnan and had rarely traveled to Jianghuai. Only two visits were deeply etched in his memory. One was when True Monarch Shangyuan, then at the Purple Mansion Realm, had entered the Xu State with his sword, showing Xiao Chuting what a true sword immortal was... and the second, was because of Li Tongya.

This Li family cultivator had left a deep impression on him, but his feelings toward him were, in truth, complex.

Because of his clan's legacy, Xiao Chuting had long known of the Great Tomb River's existence, and he also knew the secrets of the Great River and Grand Tomb Scripture; he, Xiao Chuting, had a considerable friendship with Chen Taoping.

Otherwise, the other man would never have entrusted his own younger brother, Chen Taojing, into his hands!

As for the Great River and Grand Tomb Scripture, he had seen it back when Moongaze Lake had not yet been breached and he had gone to visit; furthermore, many of Chen Taoping's Dharma Arts had been taught to him by Xiao Chuting himself. When Tomb ravine Gate was exterminated, most of its possessions were obtained by Xiao Xianyōu. To put it bluntly, he, Xiao Chuting, understood the Tomb ravine legacy and the Great Tomb River better than any of the Chen Clan's own descendants!

At the Xiao family's divine ability banquet, when Li Tongya came, he, Xiao Chuting, had sensed through a secret method that the Great River and Grand Tomb Scripture was on this Li-surnamed cultivator! He had even guessed that the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition had placed a piece on him, and had simply chosen not to alert the prey prematurely!

'At that time, the few capable ones were all in seclusion. Golden Oneness fell into the hands of that waste, Tianyuan, who arrogantly thought he had me in his grasp, unafraid of me discovering his scheme... He even thought I couldn't see through it at all...'

A cold sneer touched his eyes.

'Today's Su Yan is merely his counterfeit, and an ill-timed one at that.'

If not for the repeated moves made by those great personages, today's Li Tongya should have been standing in Su Yan's position, having truly become his, Xiao Chuting's, opponent—and he, Xiao Chuting, would never have allowed him to reach that step.

'If he had not come from Moongaze Lake, if not for the great personages, perhaps... I would have been the one to act first. Between the Xiao and Li clans, there would have been a blood feud.'

Back then, Xiao Chuting had personally watched Li Xuanling walk into the trap, feeling, in truth, relieved; relieved that the cultivators' grand stratagem, decades in the making, had contained the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition's scheme. As long as Li Tongya and his son perished at Serpent-Suppressing Temple, he wouldn't even have to consider how to deal with that sword immortal afterward.

To prevent the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition from interfering and changing the situation, Si Boxiu—who had not yet transcended the Purple Mystery—had gone, but that wasn't enough; he, Xiao Chuting, proficient in the Life Divine Ability, had personally overseen the Li Xuanling affair!

But that slight ripple on the river instantly turned his suspicions about the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance into an answer. When Li Tongya died, Xiao Chuting's attitude changed in an instant.

'It is not that I am cold-blooded and merciless. In the struggle for the Dao, even clans and immortal sects are disregarded; who is there to discuss right and wrong with outsiders.'

He gazed faintly into the distant darkness, walking forward step by step, until another hint of azure emerged in the reflection on the water's surface. It walked out from the shadows, stopped beside him, and a young man's laughter reached his ears,

"Senior Xiao! Long time no see."

The young man's voice was clear, yet it carried a natural, icy trace; even though it was filled with laughter at this moment, it still seemed unsettling,

"I recognized Senior at a glance. This Azure Peril Cape belonged to Senior Yuanxiu back in the day. It was traded to you then, and I never thought that after all these years, not only have you not replaced it, but it now has a completely different air about it..."

Xiao Chuting stood with his hands behind his back, not turning, and said softly,

"I've troubled you to wait for so long."

Only then did the azure light of the Pristine Water slowly dissipate, revealing a young man of outstanding appearance and a clear, otherworldly temperament. A string of black beads hung from his white wrist, and his eyes were a brimming azure, like a clear pool of water, yet they faintly held a demonic light.

Chi Buzi.

This Daoist Master from the Azure Pond Sect, who had been missing for many years, was currently in excellent spirits, his eyes smiling as he said,

"It is still the old Daoist Master who knew I was here, and was willing to grace me with a visit."

"You dare not return to Jiangnan. The Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter was transformed from Pristine Water, so you wish you could flee a hundred thousand miles away. Only this Chengshui Marsh is suitable—it's close to the north, convenient for you to come and go."

Xiao Chuting looked at him with open admiration, sizing him up carefully before speaking softly,

"I had thought that after not seeing you for a hundred years, and with your divine ability now complete, you would have surely changed..."

Back then, after Xiao Chuting had endured for many years and finally made his announcement to the great families, it was Chi Buzi who had come to offer congratulations. Two hundred years had passed since they parted, yet the man still had the same cold, ruthless eyes, still the same hypocritical and fickle person, as unyieldingly evil as cast iron, without the slightest change. The old man even felt a sense of dislocation.

He couldn't help but laugh,

"You are still the same, singularly focused on immortality, viewing worldly morals and mortal karma as filth. The Chi family met such an end, yet you weren't moved in the slightest. Those old men once held you, the young men called you grand-uncle, and the youths looked up to you as an example—all for naught. Chi Buzi... you are far more cold-blooded than Chi Wei. No wonder you've made it this far!"

"They died as they deserved. I don't care."

Chi Buzi completely ignored his words, seemingly too lazy to even listen, and smiled with his hands behind his back,

"But that is the Great Tomb River! A place where the water virtue flourished in antiquity. You knew I would definitely return, old Daoist Master, and that I would definitely seek you out... I also know that you have use for me, and that there is a great opportunity for cooperation."

The green-eyed young man showed no trace of contemplation, but rather smiled with perfect ease,

"Even setting aside this opportunity, Senior wishes to verify the Pit Water, which is, after all, an orthodox position of water. Even if I, Chi, were ten thousand rivers and a thousand mountains away, I would have to rush back to see just how Xiao Chuting verifies the Dao!"

Xiao Chuting laughed.

The two walked northward for a while, the color of the marsh beneath their feet growing deeper. Chi Buzi's smile remained unchanged as he asked,

"Daoist Master came from the lake?"

Xiao Chuting gazed deeply at him for a moment, his voice calm and hoarse as he said,

"Indeed."

One was the Great Daoist Master of Pit Water, who dominated Jiangnan with countless schemes and was known for thoughts as deep as an abyss; the other was the Great Daoist Master of Pristine Water, unrestrained, unscrupulous, and the Chi family's foremost genius in three hundred years. The moment the word was spoken, both men stopped simultaneously.

These two great cultivators, standing at the pinnacle of divine ability in this realm, fell silent, as if the unceasing flow of time itself had condensed into this single instant. The only things that changed were the slow curl of the demonic young man's lips and the smile deepening within his pupils.
