# Chapter 1339: Contesting Vastness

Yun Pass.

The light of Converging Water poured down like layers of heavy mist, rapidly gathering within the palace halls. In an instant, a man with a tall hat and long beard, his hair and whiskers distinct as ink, stepped out with a slightly gloomy expression, rushing forward, only to find that a heated argument had already erupted in the great hall.

"Yang Ruiyi has intervened; I fear the Great Song has already seen our unbearable state and wishes to come share in the spoils!"

"The Yang family has always been gentle; why would they make such a move?"

Amidst the clamor, a Daoist Master stepped forward. He was middle-aged, and though his frame was thin, his brow was tightly furrowed, his expression extremely cold—it was the Xun family's Daoist Master, Xun Xuanzai.

"Who cares if he makes one move or two! I only ask you what we should do right now! Since this man surnamed Yang has made his move, will that Sword Immortal act?"

"Cheng Xunzhi... The Song Emperor cannot possibly let him cross the river; the Way of Great Desire is right at the edge!"

Xun Xuanzai sneered, "The Way of Great Desire is currently still shrinking inside their Paradise, singing and chanting! They are only using us as a sword!"

The voices inside were quite noisy, until the Great Daoist Master who had been bringing up the rear returned and suddenly appeared. All sounds then quieted down, and a young man could be seen standing on high with his hands clasped behind his back, his face full of deep thought.

Although this Little Pang Daoist Master, Pang Yi, presided over the matters of the two eastern passes, he was still a junior. Upon seeing the arrival of the Great Daoist Master, he came down to welcome him, smiling.

"The Great Daoist Master has worked hard!"

Gu You nodded; he was a serious man when handling affairs, and frowning, he said,

"Little Friend Pang, this is already the third time you have asked me to withdraw. The first time was when reinforcements arrived and the movements were unclear, so I will not discuss it; the second time was to discuss some chaos in the east, which allowed their troops to escape; and this third time..."

He swept a faint glance around and said,

"It looks like a massive momentum, but since they chose to attack Mount Rao, they must be under Yang Ruiyi's protection. The reason we do not turn around and surround those few minor divine abilities, is it not also because we fear Yang Ruiyi's interference? While it is indeed Li Jiangqian's open plot, Little Friend Pang has always been known for his intelligence. Has your perspective shifted now that fellow Daoist Longkang has returned, blurring your judgment?"

Pang Yi sighed with emotion, saying, "Exiled Qi fills the heavens, how can we not retreat!"

He turned his youthful face to look at everyone, sighing.

"This junior understands the Great Daoist Master's earnest heart, but as the appointed guard, this junior is responsible for the two passes and also responsible for the lives of all the divine abilities here. Naturally, caution comes first."

Once these words came out, all the divine abilities nodded. Seeing him use the pressure of the majority against him, Gu You flicked his sleeve and did not reply, so Pang Yi turned around and said,

"Furthermore, High-Peak City has not changed color for a long time, I fear it is already lost. Once King Wei heads south and blocks the front of our two passes while all the divine abilities are still fighting fiercely outside, how could we avoid being caught by him right then and there?"

"The Yun and Pu passes are extremely solid; we prioritize holding fast."

His words held reason, causing Gu You to nod. The Great Daoist Master cupped his hands decisively and frowned,

"With Fellow Daoist Yu guarding it, High-Peak City may not be lost so quickly, but if High-Peak City is truly in trouble, then I have wrongly blamed you."

Pang Yi merely smiled without speaking.

Since the letter from his father, Pang Queyun, was delivered to his hand from within Chun City, Pang Yi's heart had long since changed. He had already seen the current situation clearly, implying that the Pang family behind him had made their choice.

'Surrendering to Wei easily will offend Dongmu. Defending to the death without surrendering will offend King Wei. One is an Immortal in the heavens, breaking one's future path. The other is a King before one's eyes, severing one's head in the present...'

The reason his father made no noise about it was to leave the Pang family a chance to maneuver. The look in Pang Yi's eyes was composed.

'Gu You's temperament is extremely rigid and proud, conceited and untamed, and he cultivates an extremely formidable divine ability. It is fitting to let him resist that King Wei. If he calls for surrender, let him surrender early. If he offends someone, let him be stubborn and offend them. We will perform our duties faithfully, wait respectfully, and obstruct him with the situation. This is the way of self-preservation!'

That was why Pang Yi—upon vaguely sensing King Wei's intent—urgently summoned all the divine abilities into the city, preventing him from succeeding.

Similarly, Pang Yi made no move to ask for help. He just stood quietly, watching the varied thoughts of the divine abilities, the emotions in his heart fluctuating aimlessly.

_Boom!_

A violent sound exploded above the great formation, causing all the cultivators within the formation to shudder in unison. Even the well-prepared Pang Yi was stunned, immediately raising his head, and sure enough, he saw dense flashes of thunder already flickering atop the great formation!

"Stormshatter Wedges"!

For a moment, thunder roared, and the great hall trembled. Gu You's expression darkened instantly.

"So fast..."

Pang Yi's voice was horrified.

"I fear Daoist Master Yu... never put up much resistance at all!"

This Daoist Master Gu had long heard of the successive defeats in the east and was extremely unhappy. His expression became even more unsightly as he said,

"Qiao Wenliu comes from a humble family, so there is no need to pursue it. Bian and Qi are both noble Immortal Clans, and the Yu clan are even descendants of Donghua. Their ancestors were all figures who suppressed their era without exception. To think that passed down to this day, not a single bone of integrity remains! I, Gu... am ashamed to stand alongside such people."

These words immediately caused everyone's expressions to change drastically. Xun Xuanzai frowned and persuaded,

"Daoist Master Yu is a gentleman. Surely there is no reason to surrender without a fight!"

Pang Yi instantly recovered his composure, whispering comfortingly,

"High-Peak City is a majestic pass of the world, a treasured land of Immortal Mountains. It absolutely cannot be lightly abandoned. Even if Daoist Master Yu has surrendered, he must still be guarding that place. Since the thunder is active, there must be reinforcements in the city, and we only need to hold fast."

Gu You nodded slowly; there was no surprise or anger in his eyes. He sensed the hesitant thoughts of the people around him, turned sideways with a sneer, and said,

"The great war has lasted long, and you have all long grown weary. I will go out of the city myself to test this King Wei. Even if Yu Xixin is with him, they cannot harm a hair on my head. As for those Fellow Daoists who wish to flee east and return, you may leave via the east gate!"

He left behind the crowd with their unsightly expressions.Hhis hands loosely gripped the air as he stepped out into the void, standing amidst that burning Heavenly Light, and laughed,

"Gu You of Jinchuan is here... King Wei, come and test my divine ability!"

His gaze swept across, and sure enough, he saw a young man in ink-colored robes standing in the sky, his golden eyes piercing, looking incredibly imposing. But what surprised him even more was another person standing beneath the Heavenly Gate, dressed in purple, with a slightly awkward expression.

"Yu Xixin..."

Upon seeing him, Yu Xixin immediately felt it was troublesome. Before he could speak, this Daoist Master Gu was already sneering.

"So it is Lord Yu! The Yu clan is also a descendant of Changtang. Today, instead of thinking about controlling Yin and Yang, you have come to act as a subordinate to Bright Yang!"

This man was boundlessly rigid and proud. This shout resounded through the skies, causing even Li Zhouwei to be startled.

"Changtang? The Donghua lineage?"

He had conquered High-Peak City without stopping for a moment in order to seize the combat opportunity. For a time, he had actually not asked about this Daoist Master Yu's noble family. Now that it was exposed with a single sentence, he was greatly surprised, while Yu Xixin felt deeply humiliated and whispered,

"When Emperor Wei was alive, who in Gu Prefecture was not a subordinate!"

Responding to him was the vast, ocean-like Converging Water divine ability!

"Where Currents Return"!

This Converging Water Great Daoist Master attacked with full force in anger. In an instant, endless crystalline water shrouded the sky, and the entire heavens seemed to turn into a vast ocean, with only the brilliant water color reflecting within heaven and earth—it was terrifying to the extreme!

'Converging Water.'

Between heaven and earth, the poison of Merging Fire was known to all. Water and fire were flourishing. The only thing that could be mentioned in the same breath as Merging Fire and cited as its Dao enemy, was solely Converging Water!

The Dragon Monarch occupied the Converging Water alone, domineeringly controlling the five waters from afar, having already pushed this united position of water to its peak. And the one before him, Gu You, who almost suppressed Juan City single-handedly, was also a genius of Chun City!

Standing beneath the infinite ocean, cold light flickered in Yu Xixin's eyes as well. The young man beside him had naturally taken a step forward, blocking in front of him, leaving only faint words.

"Break the formation."

Once these two words fell, the terrifying pressure brought by the sky-filling ocean had already landed entirely on this ink-robed youth.

Li Zhouwei raised his head, his divine ability brewing.

He had rarely fought against Converging Water cultivators; or rather, although Converging Water cultivators were all over the world, due to the millennia of control by the Dragon-kin, very few high-level cultivators were willing to take this path for their Purple Mansion Road, let alone a Great Daoist Master. From this endless ocean, he singularly tasted one word:

Vast.

The Li family's rise originated from the Boundless Ocean. In those days, when the Li family cultivators cultivated this Dao lineage, they naturally possessed true essence and dharma power double that of others, easily fighting one against many and stalling several people.

But such a Boundless Ocean was merely a 'fruit' left behind by Converging Water influencing Pit Water.

In the instant the ocean surged recklessly down, an extremely terrifying pressure emerged upon his body. Golden patterns flickered on King Wei's face, his eyes became extremely bright. Merging Fire surged on his body, and instead of retreating, he advanced, taking a fierce step forward.

_Boom!_

A brilliant white Heavenly Gate rose up abruptly, and a hazy light spewed from its center like floodwater released from a sluice, and equally thick Heavenly Light sped out, galloping across the sky, instantly pushing back the vast ocean, dividing the curtain of the sky into two halves.

Converging Water was certainly vast, but Li Zhouwei's divine ability and dharma power were equally astonishing. He galloped north and south, and there had never been a time when his divine ability and dharma power were insufficient—this was precisely his body of utterly pure divine ability and dharma power!

Thus, he contested vastness with Converging Water!

This thick Heavenly Light came surging. The towering Heavenly Gate and the ceaseless waterfall of Heavenly Light turned into thick gold, reflecting in Gu You's eyes. He had a moment of astonishment. The pitch-black small banner in his sleeve flew up spontaneously, but was suppressed by the Huai River Map unfolding in the air.

But he could not care about that much anymore. In the next instant, a vibration like a dragon turning over came from within the surging waves.

_Boom!_

The waves surged, as if a Flood Dragon was constantly threading through this Converging Water, causing the waves of the entire sky-sea to be disturbed along with it. Layers of divine ability surrounded it, yet could not slow this Flood Dragon by half a bit. Instead, it made it even more ferocious, bulging up to this Great Daoist Master's feet in an instant, as bright golden light broke through the water!

The long halberd came picking!

What welled up in Gu You's eyes was surprise and joy; his left and right hands actually each held a long sword. Navy blue water currents like flames boiled up from the swords. Gracefully turning and gripping them tight, with a clang, he blocked the front of this long halberd. Although he retreated a step, the long sword in his other hand was agile as a snake, stabbing straight towards King Wei's chest!

Li Zhouwei, however, held the halberd single-handedly without hesitation. His other hand formed two fingers, effortlessly clamping onto this snake-like agile long sword. In the deadlock of an instant, a black hole emerged in his brow, and black-gold light spewed out, permeating the sky.

Emperor's Diverging Radiance!

Imperial Observation of the Origin was held within, faintly enhancing this art. Raging Merging Fire shrouded it, and the black-gold light falling from the sky was like comet after comet trailing tails of Merging Fire, smashing the entire ocean until it undulated uncertainly, at times broken, at times mending, like the end of the world!

Since the achievement of Imperial Observation of the Origin, Li Zhouwei's Emperor's Diverging Radiance had actually advanced a step further, yet it had been long delayed in finding use—for no other reason than that this was a Yang Extreme art. When Imperial Observation of the Origin was manifested externally, it was not easy to use, and when held internally, the opponents were all Great Daoist Masters. Rather than shrouding the sky, it was better to use Southern Emperor's Profound Snare for precision and skill.

But facing this divine ability of Converging Water that shrouded the sky, when the charging momentum of "Sovereign Treading Peril" was spent, the multi-colored Emperor's Diverging Radiance came out in response to the situation, smashing the sky-filling Converging Water ocean until it was unstable and difficult to suppress him.

And in a short instant, the long halberd and twin swords crisscrossed and staggered, constantly colliding, exploding patch after patch of Heavenly Light and Converging Water in the air. In the blink of an eye, they had already exchanged blows hundreds of times!

_Dong!_

The final heavy blow emitted an earth-shaking explosive sound in the sky. Li Zhouwei turned his long halberd horizontally, his own body already covered in green-black illusions, constantly vying for brilliance with the raging Merging Fire.

The poison of Converging Water was not inferior to Merging Fire!

And although Gu You possessed vast divine ability, his dharma body was far inferior to this White Qilin. He retreated a full twenty steps, causing the entire ocean to shift and shatter. Yet, his eyes held neither shock nor anger, but a look of delight at finding prey, his voice shaking like thunder:

"Satisfying!"

Li Zhouwei held the halberd horizontally, merged two fingers, and like wiping it clean, swiped across the shaft of the halberd. Relying on his robust divine ability and dharma power, he shattered all those green-black colors, and what lit up was an extremely dazzling white.

Secondary Manifestation White-Forged Rekindled King Halberd.

Bright King!

White light climbed up his body, setting him off like a celestial god. The long halberd in his hand simultaneously turned pure white, his eyes burning with golden light, carrying a hint of joy.

"Satisfying..."

'How long has it been...'

As Li Zhouwei had roamed north and south, his cultivation base had grown. He did not know how long it had been since anyone dared to take his long halberd head-on. These northern cultivators prided themselves on their noble immortal heritage, holding either Spiritual Treasures or sword techniques in their hands, yet unexpectedly, few were willing to engage in weapon arts!

This Bright King form, achieved by suppressing enemy weapons to gather brilliant light, had not manifested in he knew not how long!

Whether it was the clash of vast divine abilities or the slaughter of weapon arts, Longkang Yao, who turned into emptiness no matter how one fought him, or Yu Xixin, who only excelled at casting spells and arts, were completely different matters.

Now that the familiar power boosted him, Li Zhouwei's might became increasingly vast. Unexpectedly, Gu You's voice trembled slightly as he let out a soft breath, raised his head, and a crack of azure blue light had already split open between his brows as he laughed.

"Let us fight another round!"

Speaking bluntly, he, Gu You, practiced weapon arts and likewise had no match in this north. Fighting Jiang Yan was bullying the small with the big, fighting the King Dai was not possible because he was hard to find, and since becoming a Great Daoist Master, these twin swords had been left idle for who knows how long!

In the next instant, that bright long halberd had already smashed down with a crash.

_Boom!_

When the Heavenly Light erupted, the horizontal long sword blocked solidly this time, but after hundreds of impacts, what remained was no longer a phantom. This Bright King Halberd seemed to split into two, the other one leaping up, vicious as a snake, drilling towards his chest.

[Preemptive Execution].

"Impressive."

But Gu You was completely fearless; he raised Where Currents Return. Li Zhouwei erected Heavenly Audience Gate. Now that Li Zhouwei did not manifest his divine ability, he also disdained to manifest his first, merely hooking his hand and raising his sword. The other long sword blocked in front of the halberd with a clang.

Now the might of the long halberd was even fiercer, causing that long sword to bend slightly, emitting a faint sound. Gu You laughed loudly, the light between his brows flickering. The long sword instantly sprang back straight, bouncing the halberd up, while his two swords merged and fitted together with speed that left no time to cover one's ears, actually turning into one sword that passed through all obstacles like an illusion, slashing horizontally!

Fast!

This long sword transformed into a streak of white light before Li Zhouwei's eyes, slicing across his throat; the white windpipe emerged first, but the wound soaked into a thin azure line the moment it opened as the long sword passed.

But the King Wei before him released the long halberd; he spoke no words, circulated no divine ability, merely spreading five fingers and locking onto this Great Daoist Master's wrist with lightning speed.

In this instant, Gu You's figure was already like a meteor, stomped down by a bright, utterly abundant Yang Heavenly Light, smashing violently onto the high mountain!

"Boom!"

This stone mountain was like a fragile thatched hut, exploding into sky-filling fine powder from summit to foot; faint golden light flowed away within it, and a dizzying array of colors already floated before Gu You's eyes.

[Pure Yang Bracelets].

The Heavenly Gate crashed down!

_Boom!_

The gaze of the entire battlefield was cast upon this spot. The struggle between these two Great Daoist Masters was like destroying heaven and extinguishing earth, actually causing the four borders to lose color together. Every single Daoist Master stopped the divine abilities in their hands in disbelief.

Gu You finally moved.

Converging Water divine ability.

"Prophecy at Hand".

In this instant of flickering light, spraying Pristine Water actually drifted out from Gu You's body. His figure turned into a cave spring, turned into clear rain, drifting away like smoke.

The vast ocean in the sky surrounded from nine directions, seemingly boundless. First dividing the sky into nine parts, then in the next instant merging into one, swallowing all the Heavenly Light.

Along with that flickering Heavenly Gate, it had already sunk into the deep sea of the Nine Nethers.

Gu You's figure, meanwhile, stepped upon the Heavenly Gate.

His face was turned sideways, a little azure blue blood trickling from his lips; those two swords were being sheathed into the scabbard at his waist bit by bit by him. Dripping Pristine Water emerged from the edges of his robes and then scattered, quickly dissipating as if it had never appeared.

This was what this Daoist Master Gu relied upon!

Once this extremely precious Prophecy at Hand was cultivated, a Converging Water cultivator's ability to preserve their life would be elevated to the extreme. Not to mention escaping like this now, even if escape was impossible, they could still preserve the greater part of their dharma body!

He gently spread open that other hand which had remained clenched into a fist. A streak of dark blue light whistled away, and what lit up with it was incredibly dense Searing Light.

In the short time of the Heavenly Gate's suppression, Li Zhouwei had already urged Southern Emperor's Profound Snare to the limit. The moment this Great Daoist Master appeared, what poured down was a dense, utterly intense killing Searing Light without any warning!

_Pu!_

The unexpected nature of Southern Emperor's Profound Snare brought miraculous effects once again. This Daoist Master's divine ability was retracted and his footing unsteady when he violently took the Searing Light, spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood on the spot, his face turning pale instantly!

This streak of Searing Light seemed to produce an even more terrifying effect on him, exerting one hundred and twenty percent efficacy. Dense Searing Light wandered over his body, constantly interfering with his divine ability, causing him to stagnate for an instant.

This instant was enough to be fatal.

Li Zhouwei's gaze changed immediately!

'Good opportunity!'

The dark blue light came whistling; Li Zhouwei, who had originally intended to strike and block this light, suddenly changed direction. He left not a single glance for this dangerous phantom color. He grasped this combat opportunity tightly, allowing the light to explode into dense cracks on his own face, urging his divine ability with full force.

Crimson Severing Arrowhead!

Pitch-black light already shrouded the sky; the setting sun, like a giant beast, prostrated on the horizon. The vast ocean had already receded into the distance; no matter how it was summoned, his Profound Banner was firmly suppressed by the distant map. At this moment, Li Zhouwei, with his armor and the Huai River Map, was even more powerful!

Watching the black-gold Yang Extreme light gathering into a stream and descending from the sky, Gu You finally dared not be arrogant. He sighed softly and threw out a tiny golden shuttle without hesitation. The sound of a surging tsunami echoed within this pitch-black world.

"All Convergences Return".

_Boom!_

Pitch-black phantom colors drowned his body, flushing countless holes, large and small, into his dharma body. But as the divine ability circulated, large and small cracks emerged in the pitch-black sky one after another, opening and closing constantly like the small mouths of infants.

Waterfalls rushed in through the small mouths, gathering into this Great Daoist Master's body, allowing him to maintain the stability of his form throughout, gently avoiding the pitch-black light. Merging two fingers, he formed a seal and placed it before him.

[Converging Heaven Resonance Profound Art]!

His aura expanded violently; the broad ocean filled the sky, as if to wash away all the phantom colors in the great desert, standing majestically once more to contend with this King Wei as an equal. But he was, after all, a step too late.

That sudden Searing Light was like his bane, beating all his divine abilities and spell arts until they died in the womb. It took him several full breaths to recover, and even if he re-mobilized his divine ability now, it was already too late to catch up.

That golden shuttle came whistling, but Li Zhouwei simply did not care, forming hand seals to cast a spell.

The sky was vast and gray, blood falling like rain.

This Great Daoist Master was confined to the spot.

The pitch-black sky split apart impressively, and a dot of blood-red surged up from the horizon.

A trace of disappointment finally flashed past Gu You's eyes.

'A pity... A pity... All-Leveling Sage was severed by the Hornless Dragon lineage... otherwise... how could I, of the dignified Converging Water of the world, lack the path to break the killing of the various domains!'

Vast Quasi‑Sage and Life‑Ending Expulsion—these two were supreme divine abilities born from the two great merging paths. Once renowned throughout the Middle Ages and feared by all, they stood apart from the techniques Emperor Wei seized through tyranny. Each was the culmination of a lifetime’s cultivation—the divine legacy of two Great Sages who had attained the Dao in ancient times.

Having lost this divine ability, Converging Water was like a tiger with its teeth pulled. Even if this tiger's strength was terrifyingly great, able to grind living beings to dust without opening its mouth, at this moment, it inevitably revealed clumsiness...

This thought occupied only an instant; the flowing light-like blood color had already streaked past, falling like a blood drop dividing the pitch-black sky into two halves. Brightening along with it were the dazzling colors before his eyes.

[Pure Yang Bracelets].

This Spiritual Treasure coordinated with the Lingering Sun's Killing Blow to the peak of perfection. Furthermore, in the sky, King Wei forcefully pushed the Dharma Art once more, swallowing golden blood, not hesitating to pay the price of the wound at his throat exploding open, letting that flickering Searing Light drift down once again.

Even if this Searing Light was primarily for confinement and no longer carried killing intent, it successfully stopped his final movement. Gu You's divine ability circulated to the limit, yet he was still distracted for an instant. Immediately following, a gentle yet stinging coolness landed on his face.

Tears of blood slid down.

In the end, Gu You was not Longkang Yao. He possessed neither that Blazing Fire's divine ability[^3] and immortal lineage nor the supreme Feathered Robe for protection. When the Lingering Sun's Killing Blow light fell, he became one of the 'many tribulations' swept away by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

The boiling light of the lingering sun threaded up and down his body, searing heat surging into his heart fire. In the next instant, a strong impact came from his chest. His spiritual consciousness returned to his body in an instant—that long halberd had already driven into his chest, picking him high up!

His two hands tightened impressively, grabbing the long halberd at his chest, but in his trance, what unfolded in his eyes were layers upon layers of infinite palace gates constantly opening and closing.

Imperial Observation of the Origin.

As if a large hand had wiped across, all the ocean was leveled in an instant. The bright great hall opened with a boom, the sound of 'Long Live' ringing incessantly. Thousands of doors and ten thousand households opened in response. When the golden light before his eyes became clear, it was actually a sky full of gorgeous golden armor and golden robes.

Gu You raised his head, the brilliant Heavenly Light shining on his face.

That was the Heavenly Audience Gate.

_Boom!_

Heavenly Light and purple flames crashed into his body like surging ferocious beasts. Terrifying pressure arrived abruptly, but this Great Daoist Master suddenly bent at the waist, crackling sounds ringing out from between his shinbones.

Yet he remained standing throughout, coughing up large mouthfuls of blood, actually starting to laugh:

"To be enemies with Mingyang, withstand one blow, and you must withstand many to hold your ground; but crumble once, and you will crumble utterly, never to return to life."

The words from the ancient texts back then flashed through his mind. Staring at the figure who had stopped his hand on high, this Great Daoist Master showed not a shred of timidity or panic. His eyes were filled with a thick fighting intent that could be called rampant.

He wiped the blood from his lips and said indifferently,

"King Wei need not persuade surrender—Gu is different from the likes of Yu and Qiao."

As he stood, surging Converging Water from unknown sources poured entirely into his body, making his pulsating arrogance increasingly robust. Suppressing the injuries in his body with an ocean-like volume of divine ability dharma power, Gu You found his footing beneath this Heavenly Gate and laughed:

"Although I failed to cultivate All-Leveling Sage, it is a pity that by further misfortune, throughout the ages, few divine abilities have dared to claim they can contain Converging Water... Today... I would like to see..."

"The White Qilin's Imperial Observation of the Origin!"

"Prophecy at Hand".

That Heavenly Gate crashed down, smashing onto the pure white ground with a rumble. This Converging Water Great Daoist Master's figure stepped upon the Heavenly Gate once more, his aura expanding infinitely:

[Heavenly Sea Within Water Secret Method]!

Those golden eyes lit up on the high seat, and Li Zhouwei could not help but show a look of appreciation.

'Seeking only to further one's own Great Dao... Good...'

He stood up.

In an instant, the entire world shook violently; the waves that surged and beat against the palace steps rose and fell. Li Zhouwei raised his hand on high, and a person was seen standing out from the Profound Generals below, impressively drawing a sword.

The sky was vast and gray, blood falling like rain.

Gu You stopped abruptly, but a patch of light shone brightly. Pure golden light shuttled over, exploding on his body, followed immediately by a Profound General holding a halberd, stabbing towards his face!

The power of this halberd strike was truly not weak; he had to extend a hand to clamp the halberd tip. The rebounding power of his divine ability rippled out, exploding on the halberd's shaft and directly blasting that Profound General into a sky full of fragments.

But in the next instant, another hand grasped the long halberd anew.

This was still a faceless Gold-Armored Profound General, but that long halberd was as accurate and ruthless as if King Wei had used it personally. Gu You's expression changed slightly. He reached out to block again, and simultaneously, the crisp sound of shattering rang out once more.

"Peng!"

Endless Gold-Armored Profound Generals descended from the sky; they grabbed the long halberd one after another, connecting desperately. These Profound Generals did not need to consider variations, did not need to consider themselves. Fast and ruthless, for a time they actually made him overwhelmed!

But in this instant, this Converging Water Great Daoist Master urged his divine ability dharma power to the limit, his Dao-Profundity achieving mastery, his expression icy:

"Demonic Defiled River"!

Infinite Profound Rivers poured in. Four Converging Water divine abilities manifested together, successfully linking to the Converging Water outside this divine ability. Various auras began to spread within this divine ability like silk and threads.

In this instant, source-less vast oceans surged from everywhere, rushing in through those palace gates, spreading with a swirl, pouring into all kinds of corridors, vainly attempting to roll up one Golden-Robed Armored Soldier after another.

He, Gu You, had already linked to the Converging Water; what he needed was only time!

His expression was focused to the extreme. Figure after figure began to emerge within the river water—some covered in scales, some in tortoise shells and crab armor. They came out one after another, pushing back the besieging Gold Armor and Golden Robes time and again, actually forcefully blocking them, and were even able to distract and block that continuous Bright Yang Heavenly Light.

Meanwhile, those two long swords in his sleeves had already leaped out, stained with the blood of his heart, swimming in the air like living things, constantly blocking the streaks of purple flame flashing over. The surging seawater, meanwhile, crossed the long steps to the high hall, binding one Gold-Armored Profound General after another. The contest of divine abilities between the two sides had reached the most critical moment.

Vast golden light lit up within the world.

Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass.

Bright Yang Killing Light!

In this world, all conceptual aspects held by Bright Yang received tremendous enhancement, and the Bright Yang Killing Light was naturally no exception!

Three methods combined into one, falling abundantly!

"Dong!"

This Converging Water Great Daoist Master's entire divine ability seemed to suffer an extremely intense impact. The water surging in the world cleared out from the chamber, and Gu You finally stagnated.

[Pure Yang Bracelets!

As layers of color rendered outwards, and the third bright Searing Light from who knows where had already exploded on his body, the surging flames finally swept over his whole body.

"Tch..."

That intense searing sensation spread once more, triggering his heavy injuries. Even though his divine ability was operating at its peak at this moment, he still spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Not good..."

The long halberd shaking in the sky instantly went still. The King suspended high in the distance had arrived close by at some unknown time, gripping the weapon tight, the sharp edge like lightning!

Li Zhouwei finally made his move at this moment—his divine ability was already far superior to when outside!

Even though Gu You clearly saw the trajectory, he still could not prevent this long halberd from driving into his chest. That Heavenly Gate seemed to grow on top of his head, pressing down heavily once again.

_Boom!_

Like a bird with broken wings, he fell from the sky to the ground once more. The surging seawater had already rushed to the foot of the throne at the highest point. This Great Daoist Master's extremely terrifying willpower and Dao-Profundity allowed him to not stop the expansion of his own Converging Water conceptual aspect even under heavy trauma!

Only the last hair's breadth remained!

A trace of appreciation flashed past this King Wei's eyes, but likewise, he raised that brilliantly shining King's Battle-Axe without hesitation.

[Splitting Light]!

Bright light penetrating heaven and earth filled his pupils. Gu You's face was covered in blood. He raised his head, completely disregarding the injuries all over his body, his thoughts calm and condensed to the extreme.

"Prophecy at Hand".

Beneath the flickering Heavenly Light, that Converging Water Qi scattered out, dissolving the falling might layer by layer. Sounds of vomiting blood and bone cracking rang out. All the colors faded like flowing light, finally revealing the pitch-black color in the sky.

Yun Pass was covered in smoke and dust; the great formation had long been extinguished. The Daoist Masters of Chun City were nowhere to be seen. Stopping at the periphery of the great formation, there was only the purple-robed figure of Yu Xixin.

This Great Daoist Master raised his head in extreme shock, not discovering Gu You's figure. In the sky, there was only a massive Heavenly Gate spanning heaven and earth, and an unfolded scroll painting depicting surging river waters hung upon the Heavenly Gate.

Yu Xixin's gaze was horrified.

'Daoist Master Gu...'

That King Wei raised his hand, wiping the blood at his throat and coughing twice, but only golden blood foam sprayed from the severed windpipe. Staring at the Converging Water light constantly pulsating beneath the Heavenly Gate, his face was filled with a calm smile.

'Fellow Daoist Gu... was ultimately a fraction short...'

An urgent voice rang out from behind. Li Ximing took the lead, speeding over with rolling Heavenly Light, stopping in front of him. Looking at his face full of cracks, his gaze was anxious.

"King Wei!"

"How satisfying!"

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a smile, pulling out that tiny golden shuttle from his chest and abdomen, suppressing and storing it with a backhand. Only at this moment did he emit a hoarse and icy voice.
