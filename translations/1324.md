# Chapter 1324: The Invitation Letter

"Though that is the case..."

The old man pondered for a long time before finally speaking.

"Regarding the Great Tomb River, I heard about it yesterday. It does not sound like a good thing, and no news has yet come from the grotto-heaven. Sanyi's Dao-Profundity is high, his Dao-comprehension is astonishing, and he cultivates the Lesser Yin. This sort of matter should have been put to him... what a pity he was captured..."

When Lu Fu heard this, he knew the other party was probing him. The Lu Clan's standing was considerable, and they always knew more than others. Moreover, he had just come from the grotto-heaven. He sighed and said,

"A good thing... a bad thing... Although old Daoist Master Wen has his judgment, I feel I cannot see it clearly..."

He dared not mention the Great Tomb River, changing the subject.

"This Immortal Dao... men walk the mountains, seeking to master the scriptures, hence it is called the Immortal Dao. It must have an end, it's just that... aside from those personages who can glimpse the profound, only a handful have ever reached it. The great ones who perish seeking the Dao are the most numerous..."

"But if there is a talent unmatched in ten thousand generations, one who can walk to that final step and attain the Grand Culmination for themselves, the paths forward are but a few..."

He said with a grave expression,

"To pursue Empty Attestation, to elevate the Great Dao, to venture beyond the heavens... Pursuing Empty Attestation is often the work of the Azure Profundity. You and I both know the capabilities of this great one; in truth, he has already achieved it... As for guiding a few disciples, it is nothing more than the usual affairs, hardly surprising. After all, having reached the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao, it is only natural to emulate the ancestors of one's Dao-path, establishing temples and palaces to restore past glory..."

Though his words were obscure, they startled Daoist Master Wen. His heart pounded as he looked at Lu Fu and said:

"I believe that whenever a peerless immortal appears, all Daoist Traditions under heaven change their names and bow their heads to survive. What we care for are their ideals. We are unwilling to have another Thunder Palace. Seeing the clear will of the heavens now, it is not such a terrible thing."

"But on this final point, the intention of my family's elder is unclear."

He paused, then sighed:

"After all, that personage is of Wu Earth."

Old Daoist Master Wen mulled this over for a moment. As if realizing a certain possibility, his expression changed drastically. Lu Fu continued:

"Since ancient times, the fewest great ones to venture out have been of the Earth Virtue! Even the widely known Lord Xu Xiang of our Dao was rumored to have wavered, going back and forth many times. Consider this: a great one of our Dao once built a tower for the Lesser Yang Immortal Lord while in the Golden Core realm; his cultivation was already exceedingly high. Later, when the Lesser Yang Immortal Lord passed away and the second Lesser Yang, Lord Shao Da, ascended and achieved the Dao, even becoming an immortal, His congratulations could still be heard..."

These words were extraordinary, especially coming from Lu Fu, the most orthodox successor of the Earth Virtue. Old Daoist Master Wen's heart filled with dread:

'What does this mean? Does it mean He will not leave so easily?'

It went without saying that the intentions of the True Monarchs of the world were clear. Luoxia did not act often, but when he did, he was exceptionally domineering. With such a great one looming over their heads, those who opposed him were utterly unwilling to accept it. Even his own people had to simply endure. But if he was unwilling to leave...

The dazed look remained on his face. He pressed his palms together, as if in celebration or perhaps in penance for his sins, and said:

"That is naturally an excellent thing!"

Lu Fu shook his head and sighed.

"It is merely some foolish notion from my family's elder. He is disappointed in my lack of progress. I listened in for a moment, and he drove me out, telling me to get lost. And so, I came here to you, senior."

Having probed this far, old Daoist Master Wen finally understood the source of his vexation.

'So there was that layer to it... I was wondering why, with his Dao-heart, he couldn't even tolerate a bit of gossip. He must suspect the Lu Clan is preparing to use him as a pawn, and is secretly worried!'

The two of them let the matter drop. Lu Fu, however, paced back and forth in the courtyard, a storm of unspoken words seemingly in his heart. Daoist Master Wen saw his agitation and, after a long while, said:

"The Lu Clan's ancestor once paid respects to the Azure Profundity, an extraordinary connection. You also possess the foundation of a Comprehending Profundity Spiritual Treasure. In the grander scheme of the Bright Yang, they would not make things difficult for you..."

Lu Fu said:

"No matter how renowned the 'Two Lus' were, they failed in seeking the Dao, and their descendants are inadequate. What prestige could possibly be left!"

As the last word fell, the expressions of both men changed in horror. The dharma lamps throughout the hall extinguished in unison as the entire structure began to shake violently. The earth quaked and the mountains swayed, and their ears filled with a piercing shriek that felt as if it would rupture their eardrums!

"Omm!"

In an instant, the two cultivators with divine abilities raised their heads together. They saw the azure sky already suffused with dense gray clouds. Pale gray flames, like a gangrene clinging to bone, pulsed with a malevolent light, suppressing the azure of the sky in a truly startling display!

"Merging Fire?!"

The two exchanged a look. Old Daoist Master Wen's face contorted, and Lu Fu's turned white in a flash. Without even time to raise his sleeves, he brought two fingers together in a swift motion...

But before he could complete the divination, all the light shrouding the sky receded. Brilliant gold shone through the grand array, illuminating his utterly bloodless face.

Within the raging gray shadows were two points of golden light. The man's ink-black robes had long since transformed into ferocious armor. A great halberd stood behind him, and the golden battle-axe in his hand overflowed with a brilliant radiance.

Like a celestial god.

Lu Fu stared, dumbfounded, but old Daoist Master Wen's heart had already sunk into a bottomless abyss. His chin trembled, causing his white beard to sway like willow catkins in the wind. The old man said:

"Fellow Daoist Lu..."

Lu Fu stood rooted to the spot. Only when heaven and earth began to tremble ceaselessly once more did he start as if from a dream. He turned his head to see old Daoist Master Wen's face, etched with bitterness:

"Fellow Daoist Lu... is your fate cursed to clash with the Bright Yang?"

In that moment, Lu Fu could not even muster a bitter smile. His first instinct was to pull a talisman from his storage pouch, his heart instantly turning to ice.

'Flee!'

'Leave immediately, while the grand array still holds!'

If he were captured alive by Li Zhouwei again, he dared not even imagine what the public opinion in the Prefecture would become!

But just as his divine ability was about to infuse the talisman, Lu Fu glanced at the old man beside him and suddenly hesitated.

'Can I really escape?'

'He is already a Great Daoist Master!'

The old man beside him stroked his beard with trembling hands, his own mind in turmoil.

The Wen Clan of Mount Jiao could not escape!

But at this moment, looking at the Merging Fire flickering upon his clan's formation, the old man could no longer spare a thought for the person beside him. He had no choice but to step forward, employ his divine ability, and call out:

"Is that King Wei in person! I implore you to show mercy!"

But his Horn Wood divine ability had barely touched the formation when ten thousand bolts of heavenly lightning descended like a torrential downpour, slamming into the grand array with cataclysmic force!

Stormshatter Wedges!

For a time, thunder clashed with Horn Wood, also striking upon the Merging Fire and causing black flames to flare. The divine abilities filling the world gave him no room to speak. The old man raised his head and saw only the massive battle-axe that connected heaven and earth.

Illustrious-Yang King's Battle Axe.

King Wei's four divine abilities illuminated the sky like a deity. The weapon blossomed with an entirely different aspect, like a great mountain falling from the heavens. Its golden light spanned the sky, splitting all colors in two, and without hesitation or pause, it fell with a deafening roar!

Li Zhouwei had crossed a vast distance to strike with the element of surprise; why would he possibly waste words on him?

"BOOM!"

A sharp wail rang out from the grand array. But the earth veins of Mount Jiao were formidable, and the array's power was not to be underestimated. Under the combined assault of Merging Fire and thunder, having received the full-force blow from this White Qilin of the mortal world, it actually managed to hold!

In the same instant, the clang of an unsheathed weapon rang out.

The sky turned a desolate gray, and blood fell like rain.

In that instant, the light of the grand array was frozen within the radiance. Before the old Daoist Master's rigid gaze, a figure stepped out from behind King Wei.

Qiao Wenliu bore him no grudge and appeared utterly indifferent. With but a light lift of his hand, the gourd he held was somehow already gleaming above the formation, mere inches away.

Divine Dan Purple Gourd.

A stream of light, black to its very core, poured from the gourd's mouth. It was three feet long and a palm's width, emanating an extreme malevolence, like some supreme poison, splashing onto a depression in the formation.

Dan Yin Punishing Flame Crimson Fragrance.

Using a point to shatter a surface!

This point of blackness possessed immense power. At the very instant the grand array was about to flicker out like a dying lamp, it finally caused the array to waver violently. The great battle-axe rose once more, poised to descend from the sky!

The old man's mind was a complete blank.

'Such an assault?'

How much longer could this formation possibly hold?

He, Wen Daoping, didn't even dare show his face outside!

But at this moment, Liu Changdie's eyes had been tightly shut for some time. With palms pressed together, he held the Profound Vault Invitation Letter between them. Before him floated the Huai River Map.

His eyes were golden as he enunciated each word:

"Profound Vault, I ask to draw from your collection, at the expense of my own!"

The radiance of a divine ability gathered between his palms. After only a moment, this Vault Metal Daoist Master released his hands. The floating scroll and the Spiritual Treasure clamped between his palms had both vanished. He then turned, and with a wave of his sleeve, his empty hands pulled an object from within it!

The object was a small drum, its surface covered in dense patterns, appearing otherwise unremarkable. Tied to its side was a circle of golden silk that cascaded down like a waterfall, and to each stream was fastened an arm's-length mallet—one gold, one silver—both shining with a pure, soul-stirring light.

Liu Changdie glanced down and, for a moment, was stunned.

But he was not the only one.

Beside him, Qiao Wenliu's expression changed dramatically. He subconsciously started to retreat but stopped himself. Even the radiant Bright Yang in the sky paused for an instant. All eyes focused on the small drum.

'This is...'

Li Zhouwei was actually quite familiar with it. The object was ninety percent similar to one he had seen in the past. But he had never imagined he would see it again, let alone in the hands of one of his own men, in the hands of Liu Changdie!

This object was inextricably linked to one name.

Qi Lanyan.

This King Wei did not hesitate in the slightest. The great battle-axe instantly fell in coordination!

Qiao Wenliu was on the verge of leaping into the air, but he suppressed the astonishment and strangeness that raged in his heart like a collapsing mountain and a tsunami, exclaiming in shock:

'What the hell is this...'

'The Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder!'

'A Drum of Profound Thunder!'

Li Zhouwei had never intended for Liu Changdie to be the main force in conquering Mount Jiao. He himself was confident, and Daoist Master Yuanbian had explained things clearly before. This was merely a test to see the effect.

At this moment, Liu Changdie reacted with lightning speed. He snatched the golden mallet, poured all of his divine ability into it, and fiercely struck the surface of the small drum!

"BOOM!"

A familiar golden radiance rippled out, sweeping across the sky!

The already crumbling grand array finally shattered before the thunderous boom and the edge of the battle-axe. Great swathes of azure light rained down, pulverized by the thunder into dense azure qi. The crisp sound of one formation pedestal after another shattering echoed through the heavens.

The grand array was broken in an instant!

The golden radiance, flooding out like a tidal wave, instantly froze the rising figure of the old Daoist Master. Its momentum undiminished, it forced out the shape of another person fleeing wretchedly in the distance, domineeringly pinning him in the sky and permitting not the slightest struggle!

Liu Changdie was stunned for a moment, feeling the divine ability and dharma power being frantically drained from his body. He seemed not to have expected the power to be so immense. As if afraid of missing such a satisfying opportunity, his face flushed slightly. He hurriedly grabbed the silver mallet and, with great effort, struck again.

"BOOM!"

The old man in the air immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. Silver lightning coursed across his face, pulling him from the stasis of the domineering Profound Thunder divine ability and back to reality. The old man's blank mind seemed to only now recognize the object in the sky.

'The Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder? Or another Drum of Profound Thunder?'

'Qi Lanyan... left it in the south? How is that possible?'

Before his blood could completely evaporate in the air, someone was already striding through the thunder-filled sky, treading on the flickering light of the Lesser Yin. His voice carried a smile as he said:

"Be careful, old Daoist Master!"

The golden light on Wen Daoping's body had not yet faded, constantly interfering with his movements. He could only struggle to operate his Spiritual Artifact. But out of the corner of his eye, he saw another streak of gold rise in the western sky.

'Lu Fu, oh Lu Fu... you truly are a calamitous star!'

His heart was filled with bitterness, but the person on the horizon was in an even more bitter state!

Lu Fu once again stood in the ink-black night, gazing anew at the golden sunset prostrate on the horizon. Unsteady arcs of gold and silver lightning intertwined over his body, leaving him standing there in a daze.

'Where did the Profound Thunder come from? How could there be Profound Thunder?'

He, Lu Fu, had used a talisman, waiting specifically for the moment the grand array shattered to escape. Li Zhouwei's people were clearly all focused on attacking the grand array, their attention undivided, making it highly likely he could slip away in the chaos. Yet, a Profound Thunder had come out of nowhere and pinned him in place!

'One of the twenty-four Thunder Drums... How could there be an Encompassing Profundity treasure of this level!'

'It can't be that Qi Lanyan was resurrected and joined Li! Not even the wildest fantasy could be so absurd!'

In that instant, he even felt a trace of doubt about himself:

'Could it be... that my fate is truly cursed to clash with the Bright Yang!'

But facing the Bright Yang's light, which was even more terrifying than before, he felt only helplessness. Li Zhouwei could capture him alive when he had three divine abilities; now that he was a Bright Yang Great Daoist Master, what other outcome could there be?

He raised his head, his face a mask of bitterness, and gave a deep bow.

"Greetings, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei, however, found it rather amusing.

In truth, even without this stroke of genius from Liu Changdie, Li Zhouwei had his Spirit Probe active at all times and would never have let Lu Fu escape. It would have just taken a little more time...

'This man... is truly down on his luck...'

Lu Fu was already on the verge of dying from shame and indignation. He stood in silence, only to see the young man before him break into a smile and shake his head. The darkness swiftly receded, retracting completely into his body.

"Daoist Master Lu, you may go!"

Lu Fu looked at him, stunned. This King Wei's golden eyes were bright and spirited, watching him with a smile.

"The Lu Clan still owes me a favor. I will spare you again today, fellow Daoist. As for the Lu Clan's reputation, from now on... that will depend on the Lu Clan, and on you."
