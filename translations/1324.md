# Chapter 1324: The Invitation Letter

"That may be true..."

The old man pondered for a long time before finally speaking,

"I also heard about the Great Tomb River matter yesterday. It does not sound like good news. There is still no word from the Grotto-Heaven. Sanyi has profound Dao-Profundity and shocking Dao-comprehension, and he cultivates Lesser Yin. He should have been the one to ask about such things... but unfortunately, he was captured..."

Hearing this, Lu Fu knew the other party was probing him. The Lu clan held a significant position and always knew a bit more than others, especially since he had just emerged from the Grotto-Heaven.

He sighed, "Good news... bad news... although Daoist Master Wen has his judgments, I feel it is impossible to see clearly..."

He dared not mention the Great Tomb River, so he shifted the topic.

"This Immortal Dao, this Immortal Dao... men walk in the mountains, seeking to comprehend the scriptures, hence it is called the Immortal Dao. In the end, there is a limit. It is just that... aside from those figures who have witnessed the profound mysteries, only a few ever reach that point. The great figures who die seeking the Dao are the majority..."

"But if there is a talent peerless through ten thousand ages who can walk to that final step and seize Grand Culmination for themselves, the paths forward are merely those few scattered options..."

He spoke solemnly,

"Pursuing Empty Attestation, propagating the great Dao, venturing beyond the heavens... Pursuing Empty Attestation is often what Azure Profundity does. This great one's capabilities you and I both know—in truth, they've already achieved it... As for guiding a few disciples, it is nothing more than those usual matters, hardly worth surprise.. After all, having reached the pinnacle of the Immortal Dao,  emulating the ancestor of this Dao-path, establishing temples and palaces, reclaiming the glory of the past..."

Though his words were veiled in obscurity, they startled Daoist Master Wen, whose heart pounded rapidly. He looked at Lu Fu, who continued,

"I privately believe that whenever a peerless supreme immortal appears, Daoist traditions across the realm inevitably change names and allegiances, bowing to survive. What we care about is nothing more than their philosophy—we refuse to have another Thunder Palace. Now, seeing the will of heaven manifest so clearly, it doesn't seem too bad."

"But on that final point, my family elder's meaning is unclear."

He paused, then sighed.

"After all, that one comes from Wu Earth."

Daoist Master Wen pondered for a moment, and seeming to think of a certain possibility, his expression changed abruptly. Lu Fu continued,

"Since ancient times, great ones of Earth Virtue who venture beyond have been the fewest! Even the widely known Master Xu Xiang of our tradition—rumor has it he went back and forth multiple times, hesitant and indecisive. Think about it—that great one of our tradition once built a tower for the Lesser Yang Immortal Lord while in the Golden Core realm. His cultivation was already exceedingly high. Later, when the Lesser Yang Immortal Lord passed away and the second Lesser Yang, Lord Shao Da, ascended and achieved the Dao, even becoming an immortal, His congratulations could still be heard..."

These words held extraordinary significance, especially coming from the mouth of Lu Fu, the most orthodox successor of Earth Virtue. Old Daoist Master Wen's heart trembled with anxiety.

'What does this mean? It means He won't leave easily?'

Needless to say, the will of the various True Monarchs of this world was certainly obvious. Though Luoxia rarely took action, when they did, it was exceptionally domineering. With such a great one looming overhead, those who were at odds with them were incredibly unwilling. Even their own people had to harbor a heart of endurance. But if He was unwilling to leave...

He kept a look of sudden realization on his face, pressing his palms together as if in celebration, yet also like a confession of sin, saying,

"That is naturally a very good thing!"

Lu Fu shook his head and sighed.

"Just some foolish views from my family elder. He was frustrated at my lack of progress. I listened from the side, and he drove me out, telling me to get lost and stay far away. So I came here to you, senior."

Having probed to this point, Daoist Master Wen finally understood where his vexation came from.

'So there's this layer of relationship... No wonder with his Dao-heart, he couldn't endure even this bit of gossip. He probably suspects the Lu clan is prepared to use him as an abandoned pawn, worrying secretly!'

The two finally set aside this topic, but Lu Fu kept pacing back and forth in the courtyard, his heart seemingly filled with countless words. Daoist Master Wen saw the restlessness in his heart and after a long while said,

"The Lu clan ancestors once worshiped Azure Profundity. They are extraordinary and possess the foundation of a Comprehending Profundity's Numinous Treasure. In the grand situation of Bright Yang, they surely won't make things difficult for you all..."

Lu Fu replied, "No matter how vast the name of the Two Lus is, having failed in seeking the Dao, with descendants who can't measure up, how can there be any prestige left!"

As the last word fell, the expressions of both men changed in horror. All the dharma lamps in the entire great hall extinguished simultaneously. The ground shook and the mountains swayed, and their ears were filled with sharp whistling sounds, as if trying to pierce through their eardrums!

"Buzz!"

In an instant, the two divine ability users raised their heads together to see that the azure sky was already filled with thick grey clouds. That pale grey fire was like maggots attached to bone, pulsating with a malicious light, suppressing the azure color within the sky. It was extremely shocking!

"Merging Fire?!"

The two exchanged a glance. Daoist Master Wen's expression changed drastically, while Lu Fu's face went white in an instant. Too hurried to even lift his sleeves, he brought two fingers together, pinching and pushing...

But before he could perform the divination, all the light shrouding the horizon retreated, and brilliant gold penetrated the great formation, illuminating his bloodless face.

Within that raging grey shadow were two points of golden radiance. The ink-black clothes on the man's body had long since transformed into ferocious armor. A long halberd stood behind him, and the golden battle axe in his hand brimmed with brilliant splendor.

Like a celestial god.

Lu Fu watched in a daze, but Daoist Master Wen's heart had already sunk to the bottom. His chin trembled slightly, causing his white beard to flutter like willow catkins in the wind.

"Fellow Daoist Lu..."

Lu Fu stood blankly on the spot. Only when heaven and earth shook unceasingly once more did he wake as if from a dream. He turned his head to see Daoist Master Wen's face full of bitterness.

"Fellow Daoist Lu... is your fate at odds with Bright Yang?"

In this instant, Lu Fu could not even smile bitterly. His first reaction was to fish out a talisman from his storage bag, his heart instantly turning cold.

'Run!'

'While the great formation is not yet broken, run immediately!'

If he were captured alive by Li Zhouwei again, he simply dared not imagine what public opinion in the prefecture would become!

But the moment his divine ability was about to suffuse the talisman, Lu Fu looked at the old man beside him and suddenly hesitated.

'Can I really escape?'

'He is already a Great Daoist Master!'

The old man beside him stroked his beard with trembling hands, his heart equally a tangled mess.

The Wen clan of Mount Jiao could not run!

But in this instant, seeing the Merging Fire flickering upon his own formation, the old man could no longer care about the person beside him. He was forced to step forward and unleash his divine ability, shouting,

"Is that King Wei in person! Please show mercy!"

But just as his Horn Wood divine ability touched the formation, ten thousand bolts of heavenly thunder descended from the sky like dense, torrential rain, smashing against the great array with overwhelming momentum!

Stormshatter Wedges!

For a time, thunder and Horn Wood clashed, striking against the Merging Fire. Black flames billowed in waves. The divine abilities filling heaven and earth gave him no voice to interject. When the old man raised his head, he saw only that heaven-spanning long axe.

Illustrious-Yang King's Battle Axe.

That King Wei's four divine abilities illuminated the sky like a deity. This artifact bloomed with a completely different posture, like a great mountain descending from the heavens. The gold spanning the horizon divided all colors in half. Without hesitation, without stagnation, it crashed down!

Li Zhouwei had come across the distance to strike with the element of surprise. How could he possibly waste words with him?

"Boom!"

A violent wail rang out from above the great formation. However, the earth veins of Mount Jiao were formidable, and the power of this array was not shallow. Under the interweaving of Merging Fire and thunder, having taken a full-force blow from this White Qilin of the mortal world, it actually managed to hold!

In the same instant, the clanging sound of unsheathing rang out.

The sky was boundless; blood fell like rain.

In this moment, the light and color of the great formation were congealed within the radiance. Under the stiff gaze of the old Daoist Master, King Wei stepped out from behind him alone.

Qiao Wenliu had no enmity or grievance with him and appeared indifferent at this moment. With a gentle lift, the gourd in his hand was shining above the formation before anyone realized it, close at hand.

Divine Dan Purple Gourd.

A stream of flowing light, pitch-black to the extreme, poured from the mouth of the gourd. Three feet long, one palm wide, extremely malicious, like some supreme poison, it splashed into the depression of the formation.

Dan Yin Punishing Flame - Crimson Fragrance.

Piercing the surface with a point!

This single point of blackness possessed immense power. In the instant the great formation was about to exhaust itself, flickering between light and dark, finally causing the array to become unstable. The long axe raised once more, poised to descend from the heavens!

The old man's mind was a blank slate.

'Such a lineup?'

How much longer could this formation hold?

He, Wen Daoping, did not even dare to stick his head out!

However, Liu Changdie had long since closed his eyes. His palms were pressed together, holding the Profound Vault Invitation Letter between them, while the Huai River Map floated before him.

His eyes were golden yellow as he spoke, enunciating each word,

"Invoke the Treasury within the Profound, expend the stored wealth!"

The radiance of divine ability gathered between his palms. After merely an instant, this Vault Metal Daoist Master released his hands. The scroll floating before him and the Spiritual Treasure clamped between his palms all disappeared. He turned and waved his sleeves, and his empty hands actually retrieved an object from within his own sleeves!

This object turned out to be a small drum, covered in dense patterns. It looked unremarkable. A circle of gold silk was tied to its side, flowing down like a waterfall. Tied separately to it were two small sticks the length of a forearm, one gold and one silver, both shining with a bright, soul-capturing light.

Liu Changdie looked down, and in an instant, he was stunned.

He was not the only one stunned.

To the side, Qiao Wenliu's expression changed drastically. He subconsciously wanted to retreat but stopped himself. Even the scorching Bright Yang radiance in the sky stagnated for a moment. All gazes concentrated on that small drum.

'This is...'

Li Zhouwei was actually quite familiar with it. The object before his eyes was ninety percent similar to what he had seen years ago—but he had never thought he would see this thing again, and upon seeing it again, it would be in the hands of one of his own, in Liu Changdie's hands!

This item could not be separated from a name.

Qi Lanyan.

This King Wei did not hesitate in the slightest; the long axe coordinated instantly and fell!

Qiao Wenliu was about to jump up, yet he suppressed the shock and strangeness in his heart that resembled a landslide or tsunami, crying out in horror:

'That motherf**ker is...'

'Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder!'

'The Drum of Profound Thunder!'

Li Zhouwei had never planned for Liu Changdie to be the main force in conquering Mount Jiao. He had confidence in himself. Moreover, Daoist Master Yuanbian had explained it in detail earlier, and he had understood—it was nothing more than a try, to see the effect.

At this moment, Liu Changdie reacted extremely fast. Like lightning, he gripped the golden stick, poured all his divine ability into it, and smashed it ruthlessly onto the face of that small drum!

"Boom!"

A familiar golden radiance rippled out, sweeping across the horizon!

The already teetering great formation finally shattered into pieces before this thunderclap and the axe blade. Large swathes of azure light fell, pulverized into dense azure qi within the thunder. The crisp sounds of array platforms shattering resonated through the sky.

The great formation was broken in an instant!

The golden radiance flooded out like ocean waves, instantly fixing the rising figure of the old Daoist Master in place. Its momentum did not diminish, forcing a figure fleeing wretchedly in the distance to reveal himself, domineeringly freezing him in the sky, allowing not a shred of struggle!

Liu Changdie was sluggish for a moment, feeling the dharma power of his divine ability being crazily drawn out from his body. It seemed he had not expected the power to be this great. As if afraid of missing a satisfying opportunity, his face suddenly turned slightly red, and he hurriedly pinched the silver stick, smashing it down again with great effort.

"Boom!"

The old man in the air immediately spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Silver thunder roamed all over his face, pulling him back to reality from the stagnation brought by the domineering Profound Thunder divine ability. It seemed only now did the old man's blank mind recognize the thing in the sky.

'Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder? Or another Drum of Profound Thunder?'

'Qi Lanyan... left the item in the south? How is that possible?'

Before his blood could evaporate completely in the air, someone was already traversing through the sky full of thunder, stepping on the unstable light of Lesser Yin. The voice carried a smile, saying,

"Old Daoist Master, be careful!"

The golden light on Wen Daoping's body had not yet thoroughly faded, interfering with his movements at every moment. He could only struggle to manipulate his Spiritual Artifact. But out of the corner of his eye, he saw another beam of gold rising in the western sky.

'Lu Fu, oh Lu Fu... you truly are a jinx!'

His heart was filled with bitterness, but the man on the horizon was even more bitter than him!

Lu Fu stood once again in the pitch-black night, staring anew at the golden setting sun prostrate on the ground at the horizon. Jumping gold and silver thunder intertwined on his body, causing him to stand there dumbly.

'Where did the Profound Thunder come from? How can there be Profound Thunder?'

He, Lu Fu, had used a talisman, specifically waiting for the instant the great formation shattered to flee. Li Zhouwei and all his people were besieging the great formation with no distractions; it was highly possible to fish in troubled waters. Yet inexplicably, a bolt of Profound Thunder came and fixed him in place!

'One of the twenty-four Thunder Drums... How could they have an Encompassing Profundity Treasure of this level!'

'It can't be that Qi Lanyan came back to life and defected to the Li clan! Even boundless fantasies don't have such exaggerated events!'

In this instant, he actually harbored a trace of suspicion toward himself.

'Could it be... is my fate truly at odds with Bright Yang!'

But facing that Bright Yang radiance, which was even more terrifying than before, he only felt powerless. Li Zhouwei could capture him alive when he had three divine abilities. Now that he was a Bright Yang Great Daoist Master, what other outcome could there be?

He raised his head, his face full of bitterness, and bowed deeply, saying,

"Greetings, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, found it quite amusing.

In truth, even without Liu Changdie's stroke of genius, Li Zhouwei had Spirit Probe active at all times. Naturally, he wouldn't have let Lu Fu run away; it would have merely cost a bit more time...

'This person... really has bad luck...'

Lu Fu was already dying of shame and indignation, standing in silence. Yet he saw the young man before him burst into laughter and shake his head. The darkness retreated rapidly, withdrawing entirely back into his body.

"Daoist Master Lu, you may go!"

Lu Fu looked at him blankly. This King Wei's golden eyes were piercing and bright, looking at him with a smile.

"The Lu clan still owes me a favor. Today I spare fellow Daoist again. The Lu clan's reputation... hereafter... depends on the Lu clan and Fellow Daoist."
