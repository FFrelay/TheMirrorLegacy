# Chapter 1345: Stirring Thoughts

As these three words were spoken, wails of grief rose from the outside, surging from near to far. Amidst the gradually dissipating rain, one could faintly hear the weeping voices passing through the mountains.

"Old Master!"

"The Old Ancestor is gone!"

The people down the mountain also heard the commotion, and vague sounds of crying rose from all directions. Li Ximing merely lowered his head. On the ground, the elderly man's corpse had already gradually dissolved into a puddle of Pristine Water—he had consumed many good things during his lifetime. Although his life force was completely exhausted, he was ultimately not an ordinary Qi Refining cultivator.

As the clear water rippled, the robes soaked on the ground. The bamboo tube Li Zhouming customarily used to order plays had also spilled, and several scattered bamboo sticks lay on the ground, looking particularly piercing to the eye.

Li Ximing kowtowed, and only then did he collect both the Pristine Water and the robes into a casket. He then picked up the six golden pearls one by one and laid them upon the clothing. Li Quewan knelt likewise, gathering the bamboo slips scattered all over the floor and inserting them back into the bamboo tube one by one.

Li Ximing seemed not to notice. He pondered deeply for a breath, then finally picked up the jade knife as well and placed it into the casket. Only that single bamboo stick remained hidden in his sleeve, motionless.

He stood up, holding the casket with both hands, and walked somewhat staggeringly out of the hall. Juniors on both sides looked on, kneeling and crying one after another. For a time, sounds of grief rose everywhere.

The Li family's Chengming generation had few survivors left after the devil calamity of years past. Li Minggong was always reserved with her emotions, only kneeling to the side and wiping away tears. The Zhouxing generation was currently the most numerous. Li Xinghan and Li Zhouluo had received pointers from the old man, and at this moment, they were weeping uncontrollably. Li Zhoufang was older and full of white hair, kneeling on the ground looking lost and bereft.

Only the burly Li Zhouda wept with abandon, howling loudly while mumbling something unintelligible. He bit through his lip until it bled without realizing it, leaving Li Jiangchun to wipe his tears and support him.

This Daoist Master walked all the way out of the ancestral hall, holding the casket squarely before the two halls. His footsteps came to an abrupt halt as he stared blankly at the grandson kneeling before him, speaking softly,

"The Old Master favored you the most... Come..."

Li Zhouming's eyes were already bloodshot. Unlike Li Zhouda's unbridled howling and Li Zhouluo's low sobbing, he appeared weighed down with heavy thoughts. At this moment, he stood up like a walking corpse, receiving the casket with both hands and walking forward dazedly.

As the crowd flocked forward to escort him, their cries shaking the heavens, Li Ximing finally turned his head and asked somewhat weakly,

"What is it?"

Behind him, Li Quewan lowered her gaze. While handing him the hemp mourning robes, she took out a jade talisman from her sleeve and said,

"King Wei instructed before leaving... once there is a response, go to the cave dwelling on the island."

Li Ximing draped the robes over himself and asked softly with some fatigue, "Who?"

Li Quewan’s expression darkened slightly.

"Suining. He is still in the cave dwelling; he did not even come for the Old Master's passing. He definitely has urgent business!"

Li Ximing stifled a breath. He looked at the crowd disappearing down the mountain with some reluctance, then lowered his head and took a step, stepping into the Great Void. In this pitch-black darkness, he finally secretly adjusted his sleeve, revealing the bamboo slip held in his palm.

He moved the thumb pressing on the surface, and his gaze swept over the three characters written in blood. He slowly closed his eyes and let his hands drop. Li Quewan watched him with concern, gently lifting the bamboo tube in her hand.

Li Ximing glanced at the woman, shook his head with exhaustion, and lightly let go. The slip was placed into the tube, mixing in with the other sticks, leaving only the soft sound of the slip hitting the bottom:

_Clack._

......

"North and south... both have troubles."

The candlelight was dim. Footsteps hurried within the cave dwelling as the silver-robed man paced anxiously back and forth in the main hall. He combed through pieces of news, prioritizing them in his heart, his breathing alternating between light and heavy.

"The current situation in the north... on the surface, implies clarity..."

Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangqian, one in the east and one in the west, had already conquered several passes. Chun City seemed to have no defensible positions left, presenting a smooth path—but Li Suining understood that the greatest, most convenient danger in this world is the Great Daoist Master himself!

'Whether it is Fu Tanjian or Jiang Yan, they are actually hidden hands lying in wait, staring like tigers in the north, waiting for us to step into this quagmire of war...'

He now fully understood.

'It is because Gu Prefecture is too special... that we misjudged in the previous life...'

'This territory of Gu Prefecture holds the status of righteousness. The True Monarchs cannot easily drive them out directly, nor can the Buddhist cultivators easily attack at will. So they are all waiting—waiting for Gu Prefecture to suffer a great defeat, to become precarious, or even for Chun City to be lost and Gu Prefecture to be occupied by Bright Yang.'

'On the other hand, they are attempting to force the Daoist Masters of Gu Prefecture to retreat to other lands and give up their territory, allowing this title of righteousness to be broken by Bright Yang. Once the two sides begin a tug-of-war, Mount Dayang, which has remained neutral since its establishment, can rightfully ignore Chun City's various backgrounds and intervene immediately.'

This point can actually be seen from the Yang family's attitude.

Why did Yang Ruiyi hesitate?

It is because the ancestors of Gu Prefecture were all True Monarchs; many predecessors were disciples of True Monarchs. The relationships are intricate and complex—who knows which strand of favor might be touched, bringing trouble to one's own family.

But to say he is absolutely apprehensive is not entirely accurate either.

'For them, these are unnecessary troubles. It is best to maintain appearances. Only if they truly block their path will they bear the trouble and push them aside...'

This is also why Mount Dayang and the Way of Great Desire initially entered Gu Prefecture under the banner of exterminating Bright Yang. Yet, after Li Zhouwei retreated, fierce friction occurred with Jiang Yan and the others, leading to endless great wars in the end!

Because this is fundamentally the same matter: they are the future barriers of Bright Yang. Destroying them is destroying Bright Yang! They are arrogant now and refuse to bow their heads, but they absolutely cannot let Bright Yang cut off its own barrier!

In this short moment of contemplation, he had already reached a conclusion:

The North must not fight anymore!

A thought flashed through his mind.

'At this moment, all five passes in the east, west, south, and north have fallen into King Wei's hands. He even holds that Gu You prisoner! This is the best opportunity!'

Regarding this Great Daoist Master of Converging Water, Li Suining only knew his name, not his might—because he was the first Great Daoist Master to die in Chun City, violently perishing within ten-odd days.

This person is also a cultivator from the Grotto-Heavens. To say his background is deep is not necessarily true; accurately speaking, he is from a small clan within the Longkang clan's Grotto-Heaven. It is said his temper is also bad, and others may not necessarily like him, but that Daoist Master Longkang absolutely cherishes him!

'With this person imprisoned, King Wei attacking Chun City has attracted Fu Tanjian. Once that Great Daoist Master takes action, he takes over Longkang Yao's position, holding the banner of righteousness, and will naturally refuse any peace talks with King Wei.'

And Gu You was forced to his death within these ten-odd days.

Li Suining had some understanding of the details—Gu You swore death before surrender, and Chun City refused to respond. Occupying Li Zhouwei's position, it was impossible to release a tiger back into the mountains. The Yang clan was also afraid of offending people. As time passed little by little, they could only remove him in the end...

This led to Longkang Yao fighting with hatred until the last moment, and also triggered discord between Longkang Yao and Fu Tanjian, eventually leading them to disarray and mutual loathing...

'King Wei currently holds the absolute advantage. Chun City's arrogance has been greatly extinguished. Aside from Longkang Yao, almost no one wants to continue fighting. To stop before the situation takes a sharp turn for the worse, negotiate with Longkang Yao, and release Gu You to exchange for the return of maximum benefits—this is the best choice!'

Furthermore, the act of releasing Gu You is not just to persuade Longkang Yao, but for a strange purpose.

To strengthen Gu Prefecture's power!

If Gu Prefecture is currently an egg, then all sides are waiting for Li Zhouwei to hastily enter the arena and break the shell of the fox exploiting the tiger's might, so they can divide and eat it... But simply by using Gu You as a bargaining chip to compromise with Gu Prefecture, one can share the sweet meat without bloodshed, and more importantly, maintain Gu Prefecture's defensive strength!

'Mount Dayang can wait, but the Way of Great Desire cannot. Once that Peacock Misheng is in the world, he will inevitably strike out in all directions. Even if Bright Yang does not make a move beforehand, there will eventually be friction with Gu Prefecture.'

With Longkang Yao as the lead, and Gu You, Jiang Yan, and Shangguan Wu'an as support, avoiding a mutually destructive outcome with King Wei is enough to hold up a solid defense line in front of the Way of Great Desire.

'And during this time... King Wei can return to provide aid, first clearing the threats beside his own bed!'

His mind suddenly cleared.

'Once the desert is stabilized... the great war in the North will inevitably be extremely fierce. Since the Lotus Temple has already closed its gates due to internal strife among the Buddhist cultivators, as long as we advance steadily north from Jianghuai, connecting to Luoxia in the west and Mount Rao in the north, we can sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight, provide relief to Gu Prefecture, and crush the Buddhist cultivators!'

'In this life, I want to swap the positions of King Wei and Mount Dayang.'

He picked up his brush without hesitation, writing swiftly on the bamboo slip. He carefully combed through it once more in his heart, thinking to himself.

'The first step is to swiftly negotiate peace with Gu Prefecture!'

This step absolutely could not be delayed. Even if King Wei stopped before Chun City and did not lure Fu Tanjian down, as long as the war in Western Shu rose, or Jiang Yan exited seclusion and King Wei's advantage was curbed, knowing Longkang Yao's stubborn and rotten temper, realizing the south was under attack from both front and rear, new variables of chaos would inevitably arise!

'Right now, the life of the dignified Great Daoist Master Gu You is one of the very few conditions that can make that proud and stubborn Golden Core direct descendant bow his head!'

He was so engrossed that he did not even notice the brilliant Heavenly Light filling the cave dwelling as the Daoist Master in white strode in. It was not until he felt the warmth on his face that he raised his head in shock.

"Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing was already dressed in white hemp mourning robes, a strip of white cloth across his forehead. There was sadness in his brows and eyes, yet he still carried the majesty of a Daoist Master. The woman behind him was also dressed in white, tears still in her eyes.

Li Suining stared blankly for a moment, only feeling a chill seep into his head before the pain registered belatedly.

'Old Master!'

His face went pale, tears welling up. Even though he had experienced this more than once, his heart still felt extreme pain at this moment, as if a piece of flesh had been gouged out. Yet he dared not delay for a moment. He simply knelt on the ground, raised his head, and held his hands up in offering, whispering:

"This junior has an urgent situation. I beg the Daoist Master to go north with speed and bring it to King Wei!"

Li Quewan’s expression changed slightly. Li Ximing glanced at his extremely pale face, then noticed the speckled traces of blood by the bedside. His eyes lowered for an instant before he snatched up the wooden slip with lightning speed. Sweeping his gaze over it, his expression changed abruptly.

"Retreat? Peace negotiations?!"

He pursed his lips. This Daoist Master Zhaojing was unusually cold. Without hesitation, he said softly,

"Suining, I fear this is impossible."

Li Suining looked up anxiously, suddenly colliding with the determination in this Daoist Master's eyes. He froze in place. Li Ximing seemed to be waiting for him to speak, but upon hearing no desired answer, he understood something and said softly,

"King Wei is about to enter Chun City."

This did not sound like an explanation, nor did it sound like doubt; it was more like a naked statement of fact. He did not say another word, but the determination revealed within the calm face of this Daoist Master wearing mourning robes was unmistakable.

'This...'

Li Suining only felt as if a bolt of lightning had split through his mind, and a chill rushed to his heart.

'The general trend of the world... how could King Wei not know?!'

He, Li Suining, possessed the cycle of a past life and knew of various changes. But could King Wei, standing at the front lines in the cracks between the major powers, not have noticed?

Of course, Li Zhouwei certainly could not know of the person Fu Tanjian, nor could he know that Jiang Yan had a great figure pushing him from behind. He could not even possibly know about the coup in Western Shu. But to say he does not know the games and schemes of the various powers, or that he does not know attacking Chun City will provoke a counterattack from the Grotto-Heavens—that would inevitably be a disparagement of this White Qilin!

'Yet in the previous life... he still resolutely breached Chun City.'

He finally understood where that sense of strangeness during his earlier ponderings had come from.

'He is not unable to overcome this city; he has the assurance to stabilize the situation. What exceeded his expectations was not people like Fu Tanjian—in the previous life, he successfully defeated them even when fighting against many. What shattered all these arrangements was actually Western Shu, the Battle of the Desert, the will of the True Monarch level!'

'He had long made his judgment. If not for that great turmoil in Western Shu, and Yang Ruiyi's sudden withdrawal without warning, he would have still withdrawn his light cavalry, holding his troops in the west and looking down from above to watch the changes in the east.'

This made Li Suining's heart dim for a moment, but in the next instant, he looked up, his eyes bright.

'Since I can think of balancing the situation in the north, could King Wei not think of it? What I want to change is the great war in the desert. As for the matters in the north, what I must do is absolutely not to offer suggestions, but to report news—nothing more. In the end, whether to fight or not, whether to advance or not, must be judged by King Wei.'

He said softly, "This junior knows."

Thus, he stared at Li Ximing with burning eyes and said, "This junior has a message. Please take it to King Wei, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing lowered his head slightly, listening to this junior solemnly say:

"People from the grotto-heavens are arriving. Jiang Yan will exit seclusion in a few days. There is a change in the western shore; troops from Shu are on the move and have already reached the desert; there is a danger of the formation breaking. Please return with speed."

The look in Li Ximing's eyes changed abruptly. He squinted at the person before him. This junior looked straight at him with burning eyes and said,

"I beg the Daoist Master to spare no cost and deliver this with extreme speed."

Before his voice had even faded, Li Quewan had already smelled the crisis within. She turned her hand, revealing that small, exquisite Valley Water Lotus, and presented it to the elder beside her, her gaze filled with worry.

This Daoist Master Zhaojing likewise spoke not a word. He took it casually, gave him a deep look, and with the light on his body shining with extreme intensity, he stepped into the Great Void without hesitation, transforming into a flickering ray of golden light and rushing straight north, sparing no expense of divine ability or dharma power.

Li Suining watched him disappear into the distance, then looked at Li Quewan, who was standing quietly before him. He bowed deeply, his words somewhat hoarse.

"Daoist Master, there will be a great war in the desert..."

He raised his head resolutely to meet the woman's gaze.

"Daoist Master Lin is a long-time friend of our family, and there is a marriage alliance between us. In aiding the desert... we absolutely cannot let him fall!"
